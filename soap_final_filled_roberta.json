Can you tell me more about his symptoms? Does he have any issues with muscle tone or hypotonia?\nPatient: No, he doesn't have hypotonia. But he has mild to moderate speech and developmental delay, and he's been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We'll run some tests, including an MRI, to get a better understanding of your son's condition. \n(After the tests)\nDoctor: The MRI results are in, and I'm glad to say that there are no structural brain anomalies. However, I did notice some physical characteristics. Does your son have any facial features like retrognathia, mild hypertelorism, or a slightly elongated philtrum and thin upper lip?\nPatient: Yes, he has all of those features. His hands are also broad and short. And his feet have mild syndactyly of the second and third toe, with a sandal gap in both feet.\nDoctor: Thank you for confirming that. We also conducted Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analyses, and we found a de novo frameshift variant in his genetic makeup. Specifically, it's Chr1(GRCh37):g.244217335del, NM_205768.2(ZBTB18):c.259del(p.(Leu87Cysfs*21)). This leads to a premature termination codon located more than 400 codons upstream of the canonical termination codon.\nPatient: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic variant may be contributing to your son's speech, developmental delay, and attention deficit disorder. It's important that we continue monitoring his progress and provide appropriate support for his development.\nPatient: What should we do for follow-up?\nDoctor: Regular visits with a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist can help address your son's developmental and attention deficit disorder needs. I will also recommend regular check-ups with me to monitor his growth and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We will follow your recommendations and keep an eye on his progress.",

Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\nPatient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.\nPatient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?\nDoctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. \nPatient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?\nDoctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.\nPatient: How long will the treatment last?\nDoctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.\nPatient: Alright, thank you, doctor.\n[After 3 weeks of therapy]\nDoctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.\nPatient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?\nDoctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary. In the meantime, it's important for you to keep an eye on any changes in his symptoms and report them to us immediately. We'll do our best to help him recover.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Is that correct?\nPatient D: Yes, that's correct. My brother went through radiation treatment and is doing well now.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that your brother is doing well. Given your African American background and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer before 65 years of age, it's important to discuss the possibility of PSA testing with you.\nPatient D: Hmm, okay. What exactly is PSA testing, doc?\nDoctor: PSA testing, or Prostate-Specific Antigen testing, is a blood test that helps detect the presence of prostate cancer. However, the recommendations for PSA-based screening vary among different organizations.\nPatient D: So, do I need to get this screening done?\nDoctor: According to the AAFP, NCI, CDC, ACS, AUA, NCCN, and ASCO, it would be less difficult for clinicians to discuss PSA testing with you, considering your background and family history. These organizations recommend that we have a conversation about the potential benefits and risks of the test.\nPatient D: Alright, I see. What do the USPSTF recommendations say?\nDoctor: The USPSTF recommendations may not recommend PSA-based screening for you. It is important to understand that PSA testing has both potential benefits and risks, and the decision to undergo the test should be made after discussing these factors with your healthcare provider.\nPatient D: I understand. So, what should I do next, doc?\nDoctor: I recommend that we have a more detailed conversation about the potential benefits and risks of PSA testing, so you can make an informed decision. You may want to take some time to think about it and do some research before we discuss further.\nPatient D: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I'll do some more research and get back to you with any questions or concerns.\nDoctor: That's a great approach. In the meantime, if you have any symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I'll be here to help and guide you through the process.\nPatient D: Thank you, doc.

The abdominal CT scan with contrast exhibited an 18 mm x 20 mm hypodense mass at the head and neck of your pancreas. We also performed endosonographic imaging to rule out periampullary lesions, and found a 20 mm x 19 mm lesion in the pancreatic head and neck region. The main pancreatic duct was slightly dilated in the body of the pancreas and the common bile duct (CBD) was distally thickened and contained sludge.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We then performed a diagnostic biopsy for pathological assessment. The biopsy revealed an irregular gray-creamy soft tissue with undifferentiated malignant tumor features at microscopic evaluations.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with a Whipple procedure. However, during the surgery, after cutting the neck of the pancreas in the left side of the portal vein, the frozen section revealed more involvement of pancreatic tissue. We resected an additional 2 cm, but the pancreas residue still had tumor involvement, macroscopically. Therefore, we had to perform a total pancreatectomy.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: Postoperative pathological studies were established and indicated a tumor with the greatest dimension of 4 cm, which was extended to the duodenum.

There's no pain and no limitation of movement, but it's really annoying.\nDoctor: I see. What have you done to manage the swelling?\nPatient: Well, I usually have a puncture and drainage of the joint when it swells up.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?\nPatient: Yes, one month before admission, I had an intermittent high fever along with joint swelling in my bilateral knees and right ankle.\nDoctor: Did you have any imaging done for your joint swelling?\nPatient: Yeah, I had Magnetic resonance imaging and it revealed a small amount of fluid collection in the joint space, but there was no evidence of synovitis.\nDoctor: Have you tried any medications for your symptoms?\nPatient: I started taking aspirin, but the intermittent fever continued.\nDoctor: On admission, did you have any skin rash or eye involvement?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any skin rash and no eye involvement was detected upon examination by an ophthalmologist.\nDoctor: Let's discuss your blood examination results. Your normal white blood cell count was 9,000/\u03bcL, but your C-reactive protein level was elevated at 15.65 mg/dL, and your serum immunoglobulin G level was also elevated to 2,569 mg/dL.

Your blood chemistry and urine tests were unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, that's a lot of information. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Based on these results and the absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and bone destructive changes in your right ankle despite your history of recurrent swelling, we can rule out some conditions. There's also no family history of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. So, we've diagnosed you with sJIA.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan for sJIA?\nDoctor: We started you on bolus methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days), followed by prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (30 mg/kg/day), and methotrexate (15 mg/m2/week). Your fever has subsided with this treatment.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What will happen if I reduce the dosage of prednisolone?\nDoctor: We've tried reducing the dosage of prednisolone several times, but you began to experience swelling of several joints, including the right ankle. So, we need to continue monitoring your condition and adjust the treatment accordingly.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

I've been doing well since the delivery. No complications, thankfully.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. As part of our ongoing study on \"Vaginal delivery after caesarean section\", you underwent a saline contrast sonohysterography 6 months after the caesarean section. The results showed a small indentation in your caesarean scar, and the remaining myometrium over the defect was 7.5 mm (Fig. ). \nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my current pregnancy?\nDoctor: At around 11 weeks, you had a dating scan with no remarks. Then, you came for a transvaginal ultrasound examination at around 13 weeks as part of our study. The scan revealed a duplex pregnancy with one viable intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy and placenta located high on the anterior wall. A small gestational sac (8 mm) with a yolk sac without an embryo was located in the caesarean scar (Fig. ). There was no extensive vascularity surrounding the sac, and you were asymptomatic.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't feel any discomfort or symptoms.\nDoctor: We informed you that there wasn't enough evidence to advise a specific management for this condition. After discussion with you and your husband, expectant management was chosen with a new ultrasound examination scheduled after 5 weeks.\nPatient: Yes, we decided to wait and see how things would progress.\nDoctor: You came to our ultrasound department at 18 weeks, 22 weeks, and 30 weeks of gestation. Throughout this time, you remained asymptomatic. The ectopic gestational sac was not visualized with transvaginal or transabdominal scans at the 18 weeks examination (Fig. ). The niche in the scar and the thickness of the thinnest part of the remaining myometrium appeared unchanged at all visits.\nPatient: That's a relief. How's the intrauterine pregnancy developing?\nDoctor: The intrauterine pregnancy developed normally with no signs of abnormal placentation. At 30 weeks of gestation, the ultrasound appearance of the scar area did not indicate any contraindications for vaginal delivery. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was 4.9 mm (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, I can have a vaginal delivery this time?\nDoctor: Yes, in agreement with you, we've planned for a vaginal delivery. The staff of the labor ward has been fully informed and prepared for your case.\nPatient: That's great news! Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I was burned pretty badly and suffered 93% total body surface area burns with a burn index of 85.\nDoctor: I see your history shows you've already had 39 reconstructive operations over 2 years. Your neck was reconstructed using a graft from the latissimus dorsi, and both your femoral veins are occluded due to multiple accesses and indwelling catheters. I also noticed a subclavian venous catheter was inserted once before under ultrasound guidance. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: During your physical exam, we recorded your weight as 49 kg and your height as 155 cm. Most of your body is covered by hard contracted skin, and there were no peripheral veins evident on inspection. To obtain venous access for this operation, we used a linear probe ultrasound device on your chest and arm. \nPatient: Okay, what did you find?\nDoctor: We found accessible veins, including the subclavian and axillary veins on the anterior chest, and the brachial vein of your right arm. We decided to use an indwelling catheter in the right brachial vein as the first choice to avoid possible complications of using the subclavian or axillary veins, such as pneumothorax or hemothorax. The right brachial vein measured 3 mm by ultrasound imaging.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What's next?\nDoctor: Due to extensive contractures, your right arm has a restricted motion range. We positioned you in the right semilateral position to gain easy access to the medial side of the arm by supination and abduction. A pillow was placed behind your back to maintain this position. \nPatient: Alright, what about the actual procedure?\nDoctor: We prepped the skin of your arm with a 1% chlorhexidine alcohol solution and covered it with a sterile drape. We also covered the ultrasound probe with a sterile plastic probe cover. The indwelling venous catheter was placed using sterile barrier precautions.\nPatient: And what about the pain?\nDoctor: We injected a local anesthetic, 5 mL of 1% lidocaine, to numb the area. Then, a 20G catheter-over-the needle (48 mm) was inserted into the right brachial vein under ultrasound guidance.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it.",

Can you tell me what symptoms you were experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, I was having a really hard time breathing.\nDoctor: I understand. It seems you had a pneumothorax on your right chest and underwent a tube thoracostomy. In your past medical history, you were free of symptoms and had no chronic disease, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And none of your family members had lung disease or were smokers, correct?\nPatient: Yes, no one in my family has lung disease or smokes.\nDoctor: At admission, your vital signs were within normal limits except for a high respiratory rate of 45 per minute. Your total blood count, liver, and renal function tests were also unremarkable. During your physical examination, we noticed a 2x1 cm palpable mass on the right side of your neck. Did you notice this mass before?\nPatient: No, I didn't know about it.\nDoctor: A computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest revealed bilateral air cysts in varying sizes with a ground glass appearance. Pneumothorax was also detected. We performed a biopsy on the neck mass and diagnosed you with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) confined to the right salivary gland. The histopathologic features included polymorphonuclear leukocytes and atypical histocytes with oval nucleus and pale granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining with CD1a and S100 were positive.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We started you on chemotherapy including vinblastine and prednisone. However, during follow-up, your pneumothorax persisted, and we had to insert another chest tube on the left side. Unfortunately, you were unresponsive to medical treatment 2 weeks after admission.\nPatient: So, what happened next?\nDoctor: We performed a chemical pleurodesis with 2 cc of talc through the tube thoracostomy. No intrapleural analgesics were used. The tube was clamped for 1 hour and unclamped at the end of the procedure. During the clamped period, you were recommended to rotate on each side for 10 minutes.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: After 10 days of follow-up, you developed bilateral pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema despite the tube thoracostomy. We then performed a thoracoscopic bullae excision with pleural decortication 10 days after the talc pleurodesis.\nPatient: What did the evaluation show?\nDoctor: The histopathological evaluation of pleural biopsies obtained by thoracoscopy revealed inflammation and foreign bodies, which were talc particles. No lung biopsy was sampled during the bullae excision.\nPatient: So, what happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgical excision of subpleural bullae, you were symptom-free for only 1 week.

My heart has been feeling weak and I've had trouble catching my breath.\nDoctor: I see. You had a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D; Medtronic\u00ae Viva XT CRT-D; AAI 60) implanted 7 years ago. This was to help with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Later, as a bridge to transplantation, you had a HeartMate II\u00ae LVAD implanted 4 years ago. No arrhythmia developed immediately after LVAD implantation, so your CRT-D shock therapy was turned off. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your transthoracic echocardiographic study at the time of LVAD implantation showed a significant decrease in left ventricular (LV) contractility (ejection fraction; 13%), dilation of the left ventricle (51 mm in diastole), and trivial aortic regurgitation (AR) without opening of the aortic valve. However, your right ventricular (RV) contraction had maintained well relatively (RV fractional area change; 33%). \nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: Eight months after LVAD implantation, you developed palpitations and were admitted to our hospital due to repeated VAs necessitating electrical defibrillation. Your echocardiography showed the left ventricle diameter did not change, but the right ventricle volume was slightly enlarged. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I had to come in because of those palpitations.\nDoctor: You were treated with various anti-arrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, nifekalant, mexiletine, and lidocain, but your condition progressed to sustained VF. This led to a hemodynamic compromise and liver congestion. We then tried a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, diuretics, and rotation speed optimization (from 8800 to 9600 rpm). These interventions reduced organ dysfunction, suggesting that minimum-required perfusion to vital organs was maintained even under sustained VF. You were followed up on an outpatient basis after that. Does that sound right?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: About 2 years after the development of sustained VF, paroxysmal AF was detected on the monitoring records of your CRT-D, with a gradually increasing frequency. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: After 3 years of sustained VF, you were readmitted to our hospital due to worsening of symptoms associated with right heart failure and liver congestion. Your total bilirubin level was elevated. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling worse lately, and I'm really worried about my condition.\nDoctor: I understand your concern. We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed to help manage your symptoms.

These serum samples were stored in the Malaria Biorepository of the University Hospital J\u00falio Muller following a malaria survey conducted in 2012.\nFamily member: Why are you using those samples?\nDoctor: We are using these samples due to the physiogeographical and population similarities between this gold mining area and the area where the two fatal HPS cases, including your loved one, were identified.

I also have a history of asthma, but no history of blood cell transfusion or medication, except for the antibiotic cephem during ICSI to prevent infection.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. At your first visit, we administered a blood test which revealed that you are D-antigen-positive and irregular antibody-negative. Your hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dl. Now, at 28 weeks of gestation, a recent blood test showed acute macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 108.1 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin of 35.3 pg. We performed a detailed examination to determine the reason for these results.\nPatient: Oh wow, that sounds concerning. What could be causing this anemia?\nDoctor: We considered several possibilities including Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but these were unlikely. Systemic lupus erythematosus is reported as a disease that causes anemia, but it was also unlikely because a test for anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Your C3, C4, and erythrocyte-binding IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were also normal. We then suspected the presence of hemolytic anemia and performed several additional examinations.\nPatient: So, what were the results of those additional examinations?\nDoctor: We found an increase of reticulocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a marked decrease of haptoglobin (<10 mg/dl). Upon further examination of the LDH fractions, we observed that LDH1 and LDH2 were markedly increased. Your urine was negative for hemoglobin. These results strongly suggest the presence of hemolysis.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me and my baby?\nDoctor: It means that your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than it can produce them, causing anemia. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for anti-IgG and negative for anti-C3d, while the indirect antiglobulin test was negative. There was no corresponding medical history or symptoms of infection that could have contributed to the observed hemolytic anemia. A blood test for cold agglutinins was also negative.\nPatient: What should I do now? Are there any treatments or precautions I need to take?\nDoctor: We will closely monitor your condition and may prescribe medication to manage the anemia.

Do you have any past medical history or trauma history related to this issue?\nPatient: No, I don't have any past medical history or trauma history.\nDoctor: Alright, let's perform an ocular examination to check your vision. \n*After examination*\nDoctor: Your best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 0 logMAR in your right eye and Hand motion in your left eye. Your intraocular pressures are 17 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. Unfortunately, the fundus in your left eye is invisible due to massive VH (Fig. a). We'll also check your blood pressure and perform some laboratory tests, including coagulating factors.\n*After tests*\nDoctor: Your blood pressure and laboratory test results are normal. Let's monitor your condition for a couple of weeks and see if there are any improvements.\n*2 weeks later*\nPatient: My vision seems to be a bit better now.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. The VH has partially decreased, and your BCVA has improved to 0.4 logMAR in the left eye. No cause of VH other than the PHA was found (Fig. b). We'll perform a slit-lamp examination to further investigate.\n*After slit-lamp examination*\nDoctor: The examination demonstrated a Mittendorf's dot located in the inferior nasal quadrant of the posterior lens capsule in your left eye (Fig. ). We'll also perform optical coherence tomography (OCT) to get a better understanding of the issue.\n*After OCT*\nDoctor: OCT showed a hyporeflective tubular structure of the PHA and an elevated tissue structure of the optic nerve, which is Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ). However, OCT angiography could not demonstrate the active blood flow of the PHA due to technical limitations. We were able to find the blood flow in the Bergmeister's papilla (Fig. ).\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: Fortunately, the VH spontaneously disappeared after 2 months, and no serious disorders have been observed in your left eye during the follow-up period.

It's a type of tumor that consists of round to spindle cells with interspersed cartilage and bone formation.\nPatient: Hmm, that sounds serious. What else did you find out about the tumor?\nDoctor: We found that the tumor cells showed diffuse CD99 immunoreactivity and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, STAT6, and glial fibrillary acid protein. The Ki-67 index, which helps us understand the aggressiveness of the tumor, was about 30%.\nPatient: Oh, okay.

Can you tell me more about his symptoms?\nParent: Yes, he was struggling to breathe and kept retching. It was quite distressing for him.\nDoctor: I understand. The initial chest X-ray at the outside hospital showed a left-sided tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and the suspicion of bowel loops in the left lower hemithorax. That's why the patient was transferred to our institution for further examination and treatment.\nParent: I see. What happened after he was admitted here?\nDoctor: On admission, he showed severe dyspnea, had a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, and tachycardia of 200/min. To address his breathing issue, we performed an immediate endotracheal intubation.\nParent: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it was necessary to stabilize his condition. After that, we performed a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan which confirmed a left-sided enterothorax with mediastinal shift. We then inserted a left-sided chest tube to drain the fluid that was initially considered to be old blood.\nParent: What were the next steps?\nDoctor: Due to the sudden onset of symptoms and a normal chest X-ray from the age of 1 year, we considered a diaphragmatic rupture as a differential diagnosis. So, we took your boy to the operation room (OR) immediately for a diagnostic laparoscopy.\nParent: What did you find during the operation?\nDoctor: We detected a left-sided Bochdalek hernia with herniation of the small intestine, spleen, and stomach into the chest. Bile-stained fluid was found in the thorax and abdomen. We repositioned the herniated organs back into the abdomen and discovered a gastric perforation at the lesser curvature, which explained the pneumothorax he was experiencing.\nParent: Oh no, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We decided that the gastric perforation couldn't be closed safely laparoscopically, so we performed a conversion to laparotomy. We closed the gastric perforation and repaired the diaphragmatic hernia with interrupted stitches.\nParent: How did he recover after the surgery?\nDoctor: After extubation on the fourth postoperative day, a retrovesical abscess was detected and drained 30 days after the surgery. Due to gastroparesis, your boy showed a prolonged recovery and was finally discharged after 4 to 5 weeks in good condition.\nParent: I'm glad he recovered well. How is he doing now?\nDoctor: After a follow-up of 2 years, your boy is asymptomatic and doing well.

I've been experiencing some left lower quadrant abdominal pain lately.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your family history a bit. I see that your brother had lung cancer at the age of 62 years and had a risk factor of chronic smoking. Your paternal grandmother had bilateral synchronous breast cancer at 80, and your grandfather had prostate cancer at 79. Is there any family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer?\nPatient: No, there's no family history of gastrointestinal or ovarian cancer that I'm aware of.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. We'll need to perform a physical examination and a CT scan of your abdomen to identify any issues. \n(After the examination and CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan of your abdomen showed an obstructed rectosigmoid mass. We then performed a colonoscopy which revealed a recto sigmoid mass measuring 4.5 \u00d7 6.5 cm, located 18 cm from the anal verge. The biopsy results indicate a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What about the CT scan of the chest? Did it show any distant metastases?\nDoctor: Fortunately, the CT scan of the chest and abdomen did not show any evidence of distant metastases. We went ahead with a laparoscopic rectosigmoid and local lymph node resection with a left end colostomy. The pathology showed an invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration beyond the muscularis propria into subserosal tissue.\nDoctor: There were high-risk features, including lymphovascular and perineural invasion. Six of the twenty-eight lymph nodes we analyzed were positive for adenocarcinoma.\nPatient: So what does all this mean for me? \nDoctor: After your colectomy, we sent the initial surgical specimen for analysis with next-generation sequencing. The tumor mutations included BRIP1 P619Fs*20, TP53 S2151, splice site 783-2A > G, CDK8 amplification was equivocal, and APC E 1295*. Your Lynch syndrome screen by immunohistochemistry (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 proteins) showed normal expression in pathological tissue. There were no reportable alterations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF.\nPatient: I had colon cancer at such a young age with no family history. Can we do an evaluation of a possible hereditary predisposition?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed an initial testing with a commercially available 17-gene colon cancer risk panel, and the results were negative. However, we proposed additional germline testing for the BRIP1 gene mutation based on the high allele frequency of the BRIP1 mutation found in your tumor.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What are the next steps for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide you with any necessary follow-up care. It is important for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep an eye on any new symptoms that may arise. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n",

You also had an important abdominal surgery due to gastric carcinoma three months ago, right?\nPatient: Yes, I had a gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and an esophageal stent because of esophageal anastomosis insufficiency during that surgery.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. When you initially presented with chills and recurrent tumble at your family doctor, you were admitted to another hospital. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When you were admitted, your inflammation parameters increased despite antibiotic therapy, and you had a recurrent fever. That's when your medication was changed from amoxicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam.

Lung auscultation and chest X-ray showed no anomalies. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that sounds right.\nDoctor: We performed some laboratory studies that showed you have normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl and MCV of 85.0 fl. Your white blood cell count was regular at 8,960/\u00b5l, but you had a reduced platelet count of 123,000/\u00b5l, elevated C-reactive protein of 12.6 mg/dl, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 310 U/l. \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: To further investigate, we performed a transesophageal echocardiogram.

How has she been since the surgery?\nPatient's parent: She seemed to be doing better at first, but lately, she's been having some issues.\nDoctor: I see. What kind of issues has she been experiencing?\nPatient's parent: She's been having trouble breathing, and she hasn't been growing as expected.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Her postsurgical ejection fraction did show early improvement, but it seems there has been some subsequent deterioration. We performed a diagnostic left heart catheterization as part of a heart transplant evaluation and discovered severe ostial stenosis of the LMCA. This could be the reason for her symptoms.\nPatient's parent: Oh no, that sounds serious. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We've decided to refer her for PCI of the left main coronary artery to relieve her heart failure and preempt the need for a heart transplant. Her physical exam was significant for congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. The echocardiogram showed markedly depressed left ventricular function.\nPatient's parent: Okay, so what does the procedure involve?\nDoctor: A cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and initial diagnostic nonselective root aortogram were performed, which demonstrated stenosis of the LMCA at the site of ALCAPA reimplantation. The procedure was carried out in the Pediatric Cardiology interventional suite after extensive discussion and planning with Pediatric and Adult Interventional Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia, Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Pediatric Cardiac Radiology teams.\nPatient's parent: That sounds like a lot of experts involved. How was the procedure done?\nDoctor: We used general anesthesia and a femoral arterial approach. An ascending aortic root angiogram was obtained in 2 planes to assess the ostial left main stenosis. Due to the small size of the infant's aorta, a 6 Fr JR-4 guide was reshaped to engage the left main coronary artery. A BMW wire was used to cross the lesion.\nPatient's parent: And what happened next?\nDoctor: Since the infant's left main coronary artery was small but expected to grow with age, we implanted a somewhat larger (3.0 \u00d7 8 mm Vision bare metal) stent at less than nominal pressure to avoid distal dissection. However, a post-stent angiogram showed that the stent had moved during implantation, missing the ostium and leaving residual stenosis of the LMCA origin.\nPatient's parent: Oh dear, what did you do then?\nDoctor: We then placed a 3.5 \u00d7 8 mm Vision bare metal stent into the LMCA ostium, overlapping with the previous stent distally and protruding 1-2 millimeters into the aorta proximally. This should help improve the blood flow in her heart.\nPatient's parent: I hope that helps her. What should we expect in terms of recovery and follow-up?\nDoctor: She will need close monitoring to ensure the stents are functioning properly and her heart function improves. We will schedule regular follow-up appointments and echocardiograms to track her progress.

We performed an initial examination, which included a chest X-ray that revealed a right pneumothorax. To confirm the diagnosis, we also conducted a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. \nPatient: Hmm, I see. What did the CT scan show?\nDoctor: The CT scan confirmed the presence of a right pneumothorax. We then performed Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) to treat the issue.\nPatient: What did you find during the VATS procedure?\nDoctor: During VATS, we discovered several diaphragmatic fenestrations that communicated with the abdominal cavity. Interestingly, your liver had herniated through these fenestrations. We resected the involved area and repaired the diaphragm using a nonabsorbable interrupted suture.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't expect that. What did the pathologic report say?\nDoctor: The pathologic report confirmed that you had diaphragmatic endometriosis. However, we managed to treat it effectively during the VATS procedure.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What happened after the surgery?\nDoctor: You underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) 4 months after the surgery, and I'm pleased to inform you that you became pregnant.\nPatient: That's wonderful news! How is my pregnancy going?\nDoctor: You are now at 20-weeks into a normal pregnancy and remain asymptomatic, which means everything is going well so far.\nPatient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome! Please continue to attend your prenatal check-ups, and don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any issues or concerns.",

Have you noticed any other changes in the nevus, like color, edge irregularity, bleeding, or pain?\nPatient: Yes, the lesion on top of the nevus has changed color, the edges are irregular, and it sometimes bleeds and causes pain.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, I found a 6 x 4-cm erythematous tumor with active bleeding on top of an 8.5 x 3-cm dark brown plate. We also performed a total body photography and digital dermoscopy which documented more than 20 additional melanocytic lesions. We took a biopsy of the lumbosacral lesion, and the histopathological results showed a superficial spreading malignant epithelioid melanoma.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. The fluorescence in situ hybridization results for the RREB1, MYB, and CCND1 genes, which are common molecular alterations in malignant melanomas, were positive for the new exophytic lesion and negative for the congenital nevus tissue. Based on these findings, we decided to proceed with treatment.\nPatient: What kind of treatment did I undergo?\nDoctor: You underwent a wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and flap reconstruction. The pathological results indicated a Breslow's tumor thickness of 13 mm, Clark Level V, extensive ulceration, mitoses of 10/mm2, negative margins, and sentinel lymph nodes with extensive metastatic involvement. We also performed a lymphadenectomy and obtained 20 lymph nodes, six of which were positive.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these results, you have been diagnosed with stage IIID melanoma, or clinicopathologically T4bN3aM0, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your neurological examination upon admission also showed that you were alert, attentive, and oriented. Your speech was clear and fluent with good repetition, comprehension, and naming. You had no pronator drift of outstretched arms, and your muscle bulk, tone, reflexes, and sensory were all normal. Your coordination and gait were also normal. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, Doctor.\nDoctor: Your laboratory investigations revealed a normal complete blood count, cholesterol, lipid profile, and renal function with a serum creatinine of 119 \u03bcmol/L. Your left kidney size was normal, measuring 9.6 cm by 4.8 cm. A Renal Doppler ultrasound confirmed renal artery stenosis with a renal resistive index of 0.58. Are you aware of these results?\nPatient: Yes, I'm aware of those test results.\nDoctor: The percentage of renal artery stenosis in the two branches of your left renal artery was 70% and 75%, respectively, before your first balloon angioplasty. After the procedure, these percentages remained the same. You then underwent a second ballooning and stenting procedure, after which revascularization was achieved. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It's important to note that you have been attending a hypertension clinic and receiving antihypertensive drugs for the past 8 months on a regular basis under close observation. Despite this treatment and care, your blood pressure remained high at 175/110 mmHg. Your attending doctor concluded that this was uncontrolled blood pressure. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what the doctors told me.\nDoctor: Initial imaging indicated left renal artery stenosis, which is why you were referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment. Moving forward, it's crucial for you to continue with your medications and attend follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\nPatient: I understand, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

He was born at full term, but he had a history of hypoxia after birth. Recently, he's been having developmental delays and trouble sleeping.\nDoctor: I see. Let's start by discussing the tests he's had so far. I understand he had a urinary organic acid analysis done. Do you remember the results?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, the results showed a high level of GHB.\nDoctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Has he had any other tests done, such as an EEG or a cerebral MRI?\nPatient's Mother: Yes, both were done at other hospitals, but the results were unclear.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for that information. We conducted a genetic analysis on your son and found a novel homozygous mutation of c.800 T > G (p.V267G) in exon 5, which he inherited from both you and his father. Have you heard of this mutation before?\nPatient's Mother: No, we haven't. What does it mean?\nDoctor: Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the specific protein, p.V267, is highly conserved among species. The mutation is predicted to be \"probably damaging\" and \"disease causing\" with a score of approximately equal to 1.\nPatient's Mother: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does this mean for my son's development and health?\nDoctor: This mutation could be a contributing factor to his developmental delay and sleep issues. We will need to monitor his progress closely and provide appropriate interventions to help him cope with these challenges.\nPatient's Mother: What kind of interventions can we expect?\nDoctor: We may consider therapies like occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy to address his developmental delays. Additionally, we'll work on improving his sleep hygiene and might consider medication if necessary.\nPatient's Mother: Thank you, Doctor. What are the next steps we need to take?\nDoctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your son's progress and adjust interventions as needed.

Your baseline creatinine level is more than 300 \u03bcmol/L. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having pain in my lower back and I think it's because of my kidney stones.\nDoctor: That's correct. You presented with bilateral symptomatic large renal stones, and underwent staged stone treatment. Prior to coming to our hospital, you had bilateral double J stent (DJS) insertion, left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and FURS and laser stone fragmentation for the left renal stones. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. But I didn't get much relief, so I came here for further advice.\nDoctor: I see. We conducted a non-contrast CT scan, which showed multiple bilateral renal stones. In your left kidney, there were 3 stones distributed to middle and lower pole calyces with a stone burden of approximately 3.0 cm. In your right kidney, there were also three stones: two in middle calyces and one in the pelvis, with a total stone burden of 3.2 cm. We then advised you to stop taking aspirin for seven days before undergoing the next treatment. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I followed your advice and stopped taking aspirin.\nDoctor: Great. After that, you underwent simultaneous bilateral FURS and holmium laser lithotripsy, and insertion of bilateral DJS under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The surgical procedure took 125 minutes - 65 minutes for the left side followed by 60 minutes for the right one. We used a similar procedure for both sides. Are you following so far?\nPatient: Yes, I remember the surgery.\nDoctor: During the procedure, we inserted a hydrophilic tip guidewire (Sensor, 0.038 in) and a ureteral access sheath (Inner diameter: 12 Fr, Length: 55 cm). The tip was located approximately at the level of the ureteropelvic junction. We used a Karl Storz flexible ureterorenoscope (8.5 Fr) for the surgery. Do you have any questions about the instruments used?\nPatient: No, I think I understand.\nDoctor: Good. During the procedure, we allowed normal saline to run from the bag, which was approximately 80 cm above the level of your pelvis, without a pump. We observed the outflow of saline from around the scope throughout the procedure. We used laser energy between 1.0\u20131.2 joules with a frequency ranging between 8 and 12 Hz (short pulses) in both sides. 4200 and 4066 pulses were used in the left and right sides, respectively.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: It's important to monitor your recovery and ensure that the kidney stones have been effectively treated.

After the preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), did you experience any new symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I developed chest and back pain and even had a fever.\nDoctor: It seems that the symptoms did not improve, and the computed tomography (CT) revealed prominent mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusion. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed esophageal perforation located 30 cm from the incisors, and gastrografin contrast revealed mediastinum leakage.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the diagnosis?\nDoctor: You've been diagnosed with thoracic esophageal perforation. Because of your age and severe AS, radical thoracotomy surgery for primary repair or resection would be difficult. Instead, we will perform a two-stage surgery and indirect approach, which includes cervical esophagostomy to avoid contamination, gastrostomy for decompression, and jejunostomy for nutrition. Reconstruction will be planned after the mediastinitis and perforation are healed.\nPatient: Alright, what's next?\nDoctor: We performed an emergency operation 32 hours after the TEE under general anesthesia. A 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope was placed through the umbilicus, and four 5-mm ports were placed in the left upper, right upper, left middle, and right middle quadrants. We washed the contaminated mediastinum with saline through the esophageal hiatus from the abdominal cavity side and placed a drainage tube in the mediastinum. Then, we performed gastrostomy and jejunostomy laparoscopically, followed by cervical esophagostomy using a tube. Esophageal dissection was performed by an autosuture device.\nPatient: How did the operation go?\nDoctor: The operation was successful, with an operation time of 2 hours and 14 minutes and minimal blood loss.\nPatient: That's good to hear. How's my recovery?\nDoctor: Your postoperative clinical course has been good. At 11 days postoperatively, a CT revealed almost complete resolution of the mediastinal air and cavity, and the mediastinal drain was removed.\nPatient: What's the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: At 22 days postoperatively, we performed an endoscopic retrograde observation via gastrostomy and found that the perforation had healed. We will continue to monitor your progress and plan for reconstruction when the mediastinitis and perforation are fully healed.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the care and attention to my condition.",

Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing recently?\nPatient: Yes, for the past 3 months, I've been having worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that. During your physical examination, I noticed a soft continuous murmur at your left upper chest and basal crackles in both lungs. We conducted a chest radiography which showed mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary congestion. Your ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also performed a transthoracic echocardiography which demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with a markedly dilated left atrium. Your LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. There was an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it's quite unusual. We performed a transesophageal echocardiography which revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We further observed an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. There was also severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: To investigate further, we conducted coronary angiography with a single RCA injection. It revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, which established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome.\nPatient: ALCAPA syndrome? What is that?\nDoctor: ALCAPA syndrome is a rare congenital heart condition. We confirmed a significant left-to-right shunt with a calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow of 1.4. Additionally, coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium.\nPatient: What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will discuss your case with our team and determine the best course of treatment for you.

Let's have a look at the swellings. *Doctor conducts an extraoral examination* There are no specific findings in the extraoral examination. *Doctor conducts an intraoral examination* I can see the presence of soft, sessile papules varying from 2-10 cm in dimension. There are two papules on the right and left side of the lower lip region, and one on the left ventral aspect of the tongue.\nDoctor: Based on the history and clinical features, I'm considering a provisional diagnosis of focal epithelial hyperplasia.

It looks like you've been treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and azathioprine for your lupus nephritis since childhood. How effective were these treatments?\nPatient: They helped me achieve partial remission of nephrotic syndrome, and I stopped receiving immunosuppressive therapy in 2002.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. I also see that you're HBV and HCV positive. Your SLE has also affected your circulatory system, causing coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction at a young age. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: In 2007, your kidney function deteriorated with a serum creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL and proteinuria of 2 g/day. The kidney biopsy showed active and sclerotic focal proliferative lupus nephritis. However, immunosuppressive therapy was not introduced due to active HCV replication. Over time, your kidney function has been deteriorating. \nPatient: Yeah, it's been getting worse.\nDoctor: Despite cardiac intervention and PCI RCA, you developed severe post-infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy. In 2009, you had ICD implantation for primary prevention. On a lupus and secondary cardiomyopathic background, you also developed severe mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation. \nPatient: That's right, it was a tough time for me.\nDoctor: You then underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left ventricle volume reduction surgery in 2014. However, it was complicated by low cardiac output syndrome, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump use. In the postoperative period, your kidney function deteriorated further, necessitating the initiation of renal replacement therapy. \nPatient: Yes, I've been on dialysis for 4 years now.\nDoctor: While being on the active waiting list for kidney transplantation, your lupus has been in remission with complement splits within normal limits (C3\u20130.93 g/l, C4\u20130.4 g/l) and ANA negative. However, you still have persistent circulatory insufficiency with reduced stair-climbing capacity and elevated BNP (619 pg/ml, normal 0-100).\nPatient: Yes, I can only climb one flight of stairs before getting exhausted.\nDoctor: I see.

I also noticed that you had a subtotal thyroidectomy in 2000. But let's focus on your diarrhea issue. Have you undergone any diagnostics to identify the cause of your diarrhea?\nPatient: Yes, I had H2-breath tests with lactose, fructose, and sorbitol. They diagnosed me with lactose and fructose malabsorption. I also had a Helicobacter pylori eradication in 2013.\nDoctor: It seems like you've been through a lot. Have you had any rectoscopies or colonoscopies done?\nPatient: I've had several - in 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2016. They found a stenosis in my sigmoid colon, but there were never any histologic aspects of inflammatory bowel disease.\nDoctor: That's correct. A computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis also revealed a long-range concentric thickening of the rectal wall with blurred confinement and fluid imbibition of the perirectal fatty tissue. These endoscopic and radiologic findings, in combination with your clinical history, confirmed the diagnosis of chronic radiation colitis. \nPatient: That's what they told me. I've tried so many treatments to help with my symptoms, but nothing seems to work.\nDoctor: I can see that you've gone through several conservative therapies, including various probiotics such as E. coli strain Nissle 1917, Bifidobacteria (B. bifidum MIMBb75), loperamide, metoclopramid, mesalazine, intestinal tea, psyllium, rice cures, and healing earth. Unfortunately, none of these therapeutic approaches led to a significant and sustained improvement in your symptoms.\nPatient: Yeah, it's been really tough. My quality of life has suffered so much, and I can hardly leave my house because of the diarrhea.\nDoctor: I understand how difficult this must be for you. I see that you've requested to undergo a fecal microbiota therapy to improve your intestinal dysbiosis and hopefully alleviate your symptoms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I'm really hoping that this therapy can help me. I'm willing to try anything at this point.\nDoctor: I appreciate your determination. On June 27, 2018, you gave informed consent for this individual therapy trial. We will do our best to help you improve your condition and regain your quality of life.

How are you feeling today?\nPatient: Hi doctor, I'm feeling okay, but I've been experiencing some issues lately.\nDoctor: What kind of issues? Any specific symptoms?\nPatient: Well, back in 2013 I had some self-limiting epistaxis and easy bruising.\nDoctor: I see. We had performed some laboratory tests when you presented those symptoms. Your abnormal coagulation profile showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12.4 seconds, INR of 1.2, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 38 seconds. Your elevated alkaline phosphatase was at 160 U/L and creatinine at 1.16 mg/dL. You also had proteinuria with 882 mg/24 h. Do you remember the results of your abdominal ultrasound?\nPatient: Yes, it demonstrated hepatomegaly with the right lobe measuring 21 cm in the craniocaudal dimension.\nDoctor: Correct. And your serum and urine electrophoreses were remarkable for the presence of a paraprotein, immunoglobulin G-lambda. The abdominal fat pad biopsy was unrevealing, but your liver biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemical staining of the liver tissue revealed the presence of lambda light chain. Do you remember the results of your bone marrow core biopsy?\nPatient: I do. It had extensive amyloid deposition, was positive for Congo red staining with classical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, and the Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was positive for lambda light chains.\nDoctor: That's right. So, further work-up of the abnormal coagulation study revealed a decreased FX coagulation activity of 45% (reference 70%-150%). Screening for an inhibitor to FX was negative. This led us to diagnose you with acquired FX deficiency secondary to AL amyloidosis. Due to your recurrent lung adenocarcinoma, you were deemed a poor candidate for autologous stem cell transplantation, so we started you on melphalan and dexamethasone chemotherapy. How has that been going for you?\nPatient: It's been going okay, but in 2015 I developed an episode of symptomatic PAF.\nDoctor: I see. At that time, your coagulation profile showed a PT of 16.3 seconds, aPTT of 33 seconds, and FX activity of 34%.

Upon admission, we conducted a neurological exam and found severe weakness in your lower limbs with a medical research council (MRC) grade of 0/5, while your upper limbs had normal muscle strength. Your ankle and knee jerk reflexes were abolished bilaterally, and Babinski sign was found bilaterally as well.

Gadolinium enhancement was observed on the T1 sequence at the level of T7-T8. No brain or optic nerve lesions were found.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means there's an abnormality in your spinal cord that could be contributing to your symptoms. We also conducted laboratory tests and found elevated white blood cells (WBC = 14100, 72% PMN) and positive IgG VZV serology, which indicates a possible viral infection.

At 33 weeks, the amniotic fluid index decreased to 2.3 cm. Maternal and fetal Doppler evaluations were normal, except for an abnormal cerebroplacental ratio of 1.08. Fetal heart tracing showed spontaneous prolonged decelerations. \nPatient: That sounds concerning. What should we do?\nDoctor: Secondary to the recurrent prolonged decelerations, we performed a primary cesarean delivery. Your baby, a live male infant, was delivered weighing 1395 grams with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.\nPatient: Oh, I'm relieved to hear that he was born safely.\nDoctor: Yes, the delivery went well. However, the placental pathology showed thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries with necrosis of the medial myocytes. It also showed subendothelial fibrin deposition in stem villous blood vessels, chorionic villous hypervascularity, and a small subchorionic placental infarct. \nPatient: Were there any signs related to thrombosis in my baby?\nDoctor: At birth, your baby showed no signs related to thrombosis.

        "Observations": "Physical examination reveals significant tongue swelling without hematoma. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy shows normal vocal cord movement and no laryngeal edema. Neurological evaluation rules out active seizure activity. CT scan of the head shows an enlarged, diffusely edematous hypertrophic tongue muscle, deviated to the left side, with no mass lesions, abnormal enhancement, or significant lymphadenopathy. Vital signs and other lab results are within normal limits."

Can you tell me more about the issues you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having difficulty swallowing lately.\nDoctor: I understand. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and found an elevated lesion 33-36 cm from an incisor tooth accompanied by ulcers at the center of the lesion. It's located in your lower thoracic esophagus (Fig. a). Additionally, we found another submucosal tumor at the anal site of the lower thoracic esophagus, which we believe is intramural metastasis.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Esophagography showed the main tumor lesion on the left antero-lateral wall of your lower esophagus and a submucosal tumor on the other side, causing constriction of the esophagus. The main lesion has good extension on its basal part, indicating that the depth of invasion is at the submucosal level (Fig. b).\nPatient: Hmm, I see.\nDoctor: We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed the protruded tumor lesion to be 3 cm in size. Fortunately, there were no findings of lymph node or distant metastasis (Fig. c).\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: Moreover, a positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan showed an increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the lower thoracic esophagus, but no findings of lymph metastasis (Fig. d).\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We conducted a blood test to check for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC). The results showed that these markers were not elevated.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: A pathological examination of an endoscopic biopsy revealed that you have moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Based on these preoperative analyses, you've been diagnosed with cT2N0M0, cStageII esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\nPatient: Oh, that's unfortunate.\nDoctor: Because you're elderly and have a poor performance status (PS 2), we decided not to proceed with preoperative therapy, postoperative therapy, or lymph node dissection of the superior to mid-mediastinum regions.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: Instead, we performed thoracoscopy- and laparoscopy-assisted subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction with the gastric tube. Under thoracoscopy and laparoscopy, we performed subtotal esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy, and reconstruction was performed through the retrosternal route.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: The total operation time was 377 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 105 ml.\nPatient: That's not too bad.\nDoctor: We started you on an oral diet 11 days after the operation, and you've been recovering since then.\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling better.

Does your family have any history of neurological or endocrinological diseases?\nPatient: No, my family history is negative for those diseases.\nDoctor: Alright. Did you have normal psychomotor development and no learning disabilities growing up?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I didn't report any cognitive symptoms either.\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted a neurological examination. We found mild dysarthria, spastic paraparesis with a wide-based spastic gait. Your deep tendon reflexes were diffusely brisk with a bilateral Achilles clonus and Babinski sign.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which showed multiple congenital brain development defects, including posterior commissure agenesis, right fornix and ipsilateral mammillary body hypoplasia, colpocephaly, right frontal parasagittal cortical thickening, two periventricular nodular heterotopic foci in the right parietal areas, and two venous drainage abnormalities in the left cerebellar hemisphere and right frontal lobe.\nPatient: That's a lot of abnormalities.\nDoctor: Indeed. We also performed a neuropsychological evaluation, which fortunately revealed no abnormalities. Your electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges.\nPatient: Okay, that's a bit of relief.\nDoctor: Additionally, a spinal MRI showed spinal cord atrophy, but electromyography (EMG) did not reveal any abnormal findings.\nPatient: What about other tests?\nDoctor: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) showed increased central conduction time from your right arm and left leg. However, no response was recorded from your right leg. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were absent in both legs, but visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and optic coherence tomography (OCT) were unremarkable.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: We used a multi-gene panel for hereditary spastic paraplegia and other motor neuron diseases to further investigate. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the hemizygous mutation c.1394-2A > G in the ABCD1 gene, leading to the diagnosis of x-ALD.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means you have a rare genetic disorder called x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (x-ALD). It affects the nervous system and adrenal glands. Your hematochemical examination disclosed normal cortisol levels with an increased adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; 352 pg/mL, normal value 5\u201360 pg/mL), consistent with subclinical adrenocortical insufficiency.\nPatient: What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will monitor your condition and provide supportive care to manage your symptoms. It is essential to have regular follow-ups with your neurologist and endocrinologist to monitor your hormone levels and neurological function.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

When you arrived at the emergency department, you were conscious, in good general condition, and apyretic, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Our examination revealed a crush injury of your fourth finger with tendons and bone exposed. We performed copious irrigation with normal saline (2 liters) at the injury site, and injected 0.5 ml tetanus toxoid and 500 IU of human tetanus immunoglobulin. We also administered postexposure rabies prophylaxis (rabies immune globulin human 20 IU/kg) with the first-dose rabies vaccine into the depth of the wound and around it.

The flexor and extensor tendons were sectioned and shredded, and the skin was irreparably shredded. So, we performed several surgical procedures, including removal of foreign bodies, excisional debridement of devitalized tissue, and collection of bacteriological samples. We also performed copious irrigation with saline serum (3 liters), tendon striping, and finger amputation with coverage of the bone by the radial digital flap using separate stitches.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds intense.

I was actually asymptomatic for a while, but recently the symptoms came back with some abdominal pain.\nDoctor: I see. When you first came in, your physical examination and laboratory tests were within the normal range. The ileocolonoscopy showed mucosal inflammation and ulcerations over a segment of 7cm at the level of the transverse colon. Biopsies were in favor of chronic active colitis. You were treated as a colonic IBD patient.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Now, let's discuss your recent visit in January 2015. Your physical examination and lab tests were normal again. However, the colonoscopy revealed an obstructive giant pseudopolyp at the level of the transverse colon. The biopsies showed chronic inflammation with architectural distortion and granulation tissue formation. Did you have an abdominal CT scan as well?\nPatient: Yes, I did. The CT scan confirmed the presence of the giant pseudopolyp.\nDoctor: That's correct. Based on all of these findings, you were diagnosed with colonic CD complicated by an obstructive giant pseudopolyp. The treatment was a segmental colonic resection.

During the examination, I noticed that you have a left eye lateral gaze paralysis. Apart from this, the rest of your physical exam shows no alterations. To further investigate your condition, I recommend a maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan.\n*After the CT scan*\nDoctor: Your CT scan results show complete opacification of the left ethmoid, sphenoid, maxillary, and frontal sinus along with osseous erosion of the cribriform plate. To get a clearer picture, I would like to perform a brain and orbits magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n*After the MRI*\nDoctor: The MRI revealed a destructive sinonasal malignancy with extension into the bilateral orbits. There are inferior components seen adherent to either side of the nasal septum with intracranial extension. We also conducted an MRI soft tissue of the neck, which showed the mass destroying the hard palate of the maxilla and extending into the bilateral ethmoidal sinuses, maxillary sinuses, anterior walls of the sphenoid sinuses, and medial walls of the bilateral orbits. The mass is also deviating the medial recti medially and extending intracranially into the anterior cranial fossa through the cribriform plate.\nPatient: That sounds bad. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will perform a positron emission tomography (PET) scan for further evaluation.\n*After the PET scan*\nDoctor: The PET scan shows bilateral involvement of ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, with intracranial bifrontal parafalcine extension. However, there are no signs of lymph node involvement. Considering these findings, I suggest you undergo Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery to debulk the nasal mass.\n*After the surgery*\nDoctor: The surgery went well, and we have removed a significant portion of the nasal mass. The pathology report has been amended as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, invasive to the bone, arising within sinonasal papilloma showing inverted and exophytic features. Based on the clinical and histopathological features, the disease has been classified as T4bM0.\nPatient: What does that mean for my prognosis and future treatment?\nDoctor: This classification helps us understand the extent of the disease and plan appropriate treatment options.

Let's start by taking a detailed look at your medical history. It seems you've been suffering from some comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart disease. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Alright, we found a pulmonary nodule in your lungs, which turned out to be an adenocarcinoma. Due to your comorbidities, we decided not to perform surgery. Have you undergone any treatment for it?\nPatient: Yes, I had stereotaxic radiotherapy, but it didn't seem to help much. The cancer progressed, and I developed lung metastases.\nDoctor: I understand. It seems you've been receiving chemotherapy with vinorelbine and corticosteroids for COPD-related dyspnoea. How has that treatment been working for you?\nPatient: My breathing has improved a bit, but my cough has been getting worse.\nDoctor: To evaluate your worsening cough and dyspnoea, we performed a CT scan of the chest which showed a large amount of gas in the adipose tissue along the caecum, ascending, and transverse colon. We then extended the CT examination to your abdomen, but there were no signs of bowel wall distress or perforation. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or fever recently?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any pain or fever.\nDoctor: That's good. The surgical consultant suggested close observation alone, as there was no need for immediate intervention. A week later, an abdominal plain film was taken, which documented the persistence of pneumoperitoneum along the right and transverse colon. As your dyspnoea improved, we decided to gradually discontinue steroids and proceed with vinorelbine. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better overall, but my cough is still bothering me.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling better. A follow-up CT scan performed 4 months later showed improvement in your condition, with the pneumoperitoneum of minimum extent, limited to the caecum. We'll continue monitoring your situation closely and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

    "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, I'd like to discuss your recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, stage III, in your right mandible. We performed a neck dissection, including mandibular and side resections. How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: I've been feeling okay, I guess. My jaw has been feeling a bit tight though.\nDoctor: That tightness is called trismus, and it should gradually improve after surgery. You shouldn't experience any pain around the TMJ during mandibular function. Have you noticed any issues with your bite, particularly on the left side?\nPatient: Hmm, no, I haven't noticed any problems with my bite while eating.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. During the surgery, we performed a VSP simulation and used CAD/CAM technology to fabricate surgical guides based on the VSP data. We then removed the affected part of your mandible and reconstructed it with a fibula free flap (FFF). The FFF was fixed in place using miniplates, with two plates per connection point.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means we were able to successfully reconstruct your mandible. The fibula was connected to the ascending ramus of your right mandible and the anterior portion was connected to the right mandibular parasymphysis. We then fixed it in place using miniplates. This should provide stability to your reconstructed jaw.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what's next for me, doc?\nDoctor: We'll need to keep a close eye on your progress during postoperative follow-up. We took panoramic radiographs 1 year and 3 months after your surgery, which showed an anterior dislocation of your right condyle. The miniplates at the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus had failed.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the connection between the fibular segment and the anterior mandibular region is not as stable as we'd like it to be. The interocclusal space in the right posterior region hasn't narrowed, but the right mandibular condyle has become dislocated in the anterior direction. This is likely due to a failure to maintain the connection between the fibula and the ascending ramus, leading to severe displacement.\nPatient: So, what can be done about it?\nDoctor: We'll need to address the issue with the miniplates. One of the plates at the bottom gonial angle area has failed, and the superior miniplate is broken. This suggests that a lack of stability may be causing stress-related fatigue fractures in the plates, leading to the displacement of the condylar segment.\nPatient: What will be the next step to fix this issue?\nDoctor: We'll need to schedule another surgery to replace the broken plates and restore stability to the connection between the fibula and the right mandibular ascending ramus. This should help prevent further displacement and complications.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doc.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

But the pain occasionally radiates down the ulnar aspect of my wrist.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any trauma to this area before? I noticed from your records that you have a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the hand.\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma to the area. Yes, I was treated for squamous cell carcinoma, but I developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) after that, which delayed my recovery in the range of motion.\nDoctor: Did you undergo any procedures for the RSD, like a stellate ganglion block?\nPatient: I did have a stellate ganglion block, but it didn't provide any relief. I've been doing home exercises to help improve my range of motion slowly.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Let's do a physical exam. I can feel a small round nodule, about 5 mm x 5 mm, with significant point tenderness.

Given the findings, I recommend surgery to address the mass. During the operation, we'll perform a deep dissection to identify the mass and its connection to any nerves.\nPatient: Okay, I trust your judgment. Let's go ahead with the surgery.\n[After surgery]\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We found a maroon-colored mass, about 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch.

I'm a 71-year-old male with motor neurone disease, and I've had worsening dyspnoea for the past 36 hours.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me when this started and if anything triggered it?\nPatient: It began right after I used LVR therapy. I don't use it regularly, just when I need it for cough augmentation.\nDoctor: Did you experience any other symptoms after using the LVR therapy?\nPatient: Yeah, I felt a sharp, sudden central chest pain, but I thought it was just from stretching my thoracic cage.\nDoctor: Okay, and how has your breathing been since then?\nPatient: It's been pretty shallow and got worse over the next two nights. I've been using nocturnal NIV with my usual settings but it didn't help much.\nDoctor: It's important that you came in. We'll need to run some tests, starting with a chest radiograph.\n[Tests are performed]\nDoctor: The chest radiograph results are in, and they show that you have a large right-sided pneumothorax. The apex of your right lung is projecting over the inferior margin of the sixth rib, but there's no mediastinal displacement.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What can we do about it?\nDoctor: We will insert an ICC to help with the resolution of the pneumothorax. This should alleviate the symptoms you've been experiencing.\nPatient: How long will I need to have the ICC?\nDoctor: You'll be admitted to the hospital, and we'll monitor your progress. The ICC was removed on the fourth day of admission, and there was no recurrence with the resumption of NIV use.\nPatient: That's a relief. What about when I get discharged? Any advice?\nDoctor: Yes, once you're discharged, we advise you to cease LVR therapy to prevent any potential complications.\nPatient: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.",

We ran some laboratory tests and your blood glucose, electrolytes, blood cell counts, coagulation test, and antinuclear antibody series were all within normal limits.\nPatient: That's good to hear, but what did you find in the tests?\nDoctor: We performed a head computed tomography (CT) and found a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) concentrated in the perimesencephalic cistern (Fig. a). We also did a CT angiography (CTA) which showed that the bilateral ICAs were absent in the skull base (Fig. b-c). The bilateral MCAs and anterior arteries were normal, but we identified an aneurysm in the PCA region (Fig. d).\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.

The bilateral ICAs above the cavernous portion of the ICAs, the MCAs, and the anterior cerebral arteries were normal (Fig. ). The right vertebral artery (VA) was fine, while the left VA was well developed (Fig. a-b). We observed moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels in the bilateral PCAs region, the distal part of the PCA was composed of abnormally fine vessels, and an aneurysm was clearly identified in the left moyamoya-pattern collateral vessels (Fig. c-d).\nPatient: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor?\nDoctor: You have been diagnosed with bilateral carotid RM, moyamoya-like vessels in the PCA region, intracranial pseudoaneurysm, and SAH. \nPatient: What's the plan for managing this?\nDoctor: Management of the aneurysm is difficult, so we have decided to adopt a wait and see management approach.

We'll need to run some tests to find out what's going on. We'll start with a chest computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\n(After obtaining the CT results)\nDoctor: The CT scan identified a calcified cyst in the tail of your pancreas. Your laboratory tests showed a serum amylase level of 402 U/L and a lipase level of 553 U/L. We'll need to perform additional imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before a surgical consultation to further characterize the pancreatic lesion.\nPatient: Alright, I'll do those tests.\n(After undergoing the additional imaging)\nDoctor: Your imaging results are in. At the time of your visit, you were asymptomatic, without abdominal pain, back pain, steatorrhea, jaundice, weight loss, or nausea. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Pertinent laboratory data included a serum CA 19-9 level of 35 U/mL, HbA1c level of 6.1%, repeat amylase level of 378 U/L, and repeat lipase level of 439 U/L.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Your abdominal imaging revealed a 3 cm complex cystic mass in the pancreatic tail, with thickened septa, and an associated solid nodule that appeared calcified, and was associated with central scarring. These findings were suggestive of a benign serous cystadenoma. However, peripheral enhancement was observed on an MRI, raising the possibility of a mucinous cystic neoplasm as well.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: The peripancreatic edema on CT was interpreted as evidence of acute pancreatitis, further confounding the clinical picture. Endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration of the cyst were not performed because of anatomic inaccessibility related to the cyst's location near the splenic hilum, and away from the posterior wall of the stomach.\nPatient: What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We're going to offer you resectional therapy based on the fact that your symptoms and serum tests reflected pancreatitis, which is attributable to the pancreatic cyst. The possibility of a mucinous neoplasm and a serum CA 19-9 level at the upper range of normal also factored into the decision.\nPatient: Alright, what does that involve?\nDoctor: You will undergo a laparoscopic distal procedure to remove the affected part of the pancreas. We'll closely monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care.\nPatient: Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate it.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Your cardiac, abdominal, and neurological examinations were all normal. Your airway was patent and your oral mucosa was moist. \nPatient: Hmm, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes. Your laboratory work showed mild anemia, but your chemistry panel and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. Your body mass index was 20.8 kg/m2. A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe nodular opacities. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast demonstrated left lower lobe ILPS. The aberrant vessel was traced to its origin at the descending thoracic aorta, where it measured approximately 1 cm (Fig. a, b). \nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We decided not to perform a bronchoscopy because it could induce coughing or dislodge a clot. Also, with radiographic evidence of the sequestration, another source of bleeding was not clinically suspected.\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense.\nDoctor: The usual treatment for your condition, PS, is resection of the sequestration. For patients with the extralobar subtype, this is completed by removal of only the sequestration. The intralobar type is managed by segmental resection or lobectomy.\nPatient: So, what's the plan for me?\nDoctor: You were evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon who noted that surgical resection would likely require a thoracotomy and lobectomy instead of just removing the sequestration.\nPatient: Alright, I understand.

So what's the plan for treatment?\nDoctor: Based on your preoperative examinations, we planned to perform a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and Billroth-I reconstruction. The tumor invasion is at the submucosal layer without lymph node swelling. Your clinical stage according to the TNM 7th edition is cT1b N0 M0, cStage I.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: The surgery progressed without any problems on dissection around the left gastroepiploic vessels. However, during the dissection of the infrapyloric area (Fig. a), a part of the pancreatic head showed unusual adherence to the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. b). This made it difficult to safely separate the pancreatic head from the first part of the duodenal wall (Fig. c).\nPatient: Oh, so what did you do next?\nDoctor: Since we needed to dissect and mobilize the duodenal bulb as much as possible for Billroth-I anastomosis (delta-shaped anastomosis using linear staplers), we decided to change our reconstruction plan of the Billroth-I method to Roux-en-Y. To avoid causing pancreatic injury during the lymphadenectomy, we focused on tracing the dissectible layer between the pancreatic parenchyma and fatty tissues, including lymph nodes (Fig. d).\nPatient: I see. Was there anything else unusual during the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, after the distal gastrectomy, we couldn't find the ligament of Treitz or jejunum on the left side, below the transverse colon. Furthermore, the right-side colon had been completely mobilized to the left-side abdomen (Fig. a).\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

Our initial diagnostics, including plain radiographs and a pan CT/MRI scan, revealed an onset of septic pseudarthrosis in the proximal tibia, intramedullary osteomyelitis, and a large abscess zone with contrast agent capturing 30 cm in the dorsal compartment. We also found necrotic avascular muscle areas, a loss of the anterior tibial artery, and a large anterolateral soft tissue defect covered with necrotic split-thickness graft that was transplanted onto bone and osteosynthesis material at the primary hospital in Bulgaria.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a complicated situation. How has your mobilization been?\nPatient: It has been painful due to the unstable osseous situation, so I haven't been moving around much.\nDoctor: I understand. Our laboratory tests showed that your infection parameters were slightly increased, with CRP at 2.7 mg/dl and leukocytes at 6.9 G/l. We also found Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem resistant) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (overexpression of AmpC-Betalactamase and fluoroquinolone resistant) in the wound smears from the anterolateral defect zone and intramedullary in the proximal tibia to the distal third of the tibial shaft.\nPatient: Wow, that's a lot of information.\nDoctor: Yes, it's important to understand the complete clinical course of your situation. Now, let me explain our initial surgical management plan. We will remove the osteosynthesis material and necrotic split-thickness graft, followed by aggressive extensive osseous debridement and resection of necrotic muscles of the anterior lower leg.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We will do our best to help you through this process.",

I'm currently at 37-6/7 weeks gestational age.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any issues related to your bleeding disorder during this pregnancy or previously?\nPatient: Yes, before my diagnosis, I had a history of easy bruising, gingival bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, and some complications after surgeries. I had hemorrhagic compartment syndrome after an ankle surgery and bleeding complications with all three of my prior deliveries.\nDoctor: That sounds concerning. Were there any other complications during your prior deliveries?\nPatient: Yes, I had persistent vaginal bleeding after my first two CDs and intra-abdominal hemorrhage after my third CD. I also had epidurals during those pregnancies, but I don't have the anesthetic records.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?\nPatient: My family history is positive for mucocutaneous bleeding, like my mom's heavy menstrual bleeding. My maternal grandmother also died due to postpartum hemorrhage.\nDoctor: I understand. Were you referred for evaluation of your bleeding disorder before this pregnancy?\nPatient: Yes, I was referred for evaluation before my cervical spine surgery. They did an extensive coagulation laboratory evaluation, and everything came back normal, including complete blood count, smear, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, von Willebrand factor parameters, fibrinogen activity, platelet aggregation studies, platelet function assay, factor XIII level, and rotational thromboelastography.\nDoctor: With all those normal results, it seems like your bleeding disorder is unspecified. The differential diagnosis could include rare congenital bleeding disorders such as undetected VWF qualitative dysfunction or undetected defects in fibrin, fibrinolysis, or platelet function.\nPatient: So, what was done to prevent any complications during my cervical spine surgery?\nDoctor: You received prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, platelets, and anti-fibrinolytic treatment as prophylaxis, which helped you achieve good hemostasis without any complications.\nPatient: That's good to know. Now, what about my current pregnancy and delivery?\nDoctor: Upon presentation for delivery, your laboratory values were unremarkable: hematocrit (Hct) 30%, platelets 169 \u00d7 10^3/ml.

Our five-month-old son has had global developmental delay since birth, and he's been experiencing remittent fever, recurrent seizures, and vomiting for the past three months.\nDoctor: I see. Let's talk about the pregnancy first. Was it planned or unplanned?\nParent: The pregnancy was unplanned.\nDoctor: Okay. I understand that your child had a low birth weight of 2.2 kg and symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Has he had any issues with weight gain since then?\nParent: Yes, he's had recurrent vomiting since he was two months old, and his weight gain has been poor.\nDoctor: That must be concerning for you. Has he experienced any regression in his development, such as loss of visual fixation or social smile?\nParent: Yes, he lost his social smile, and his visual fixation has become poor as well.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has he had any fevers, and if so, were there any negative septic screens conducted?\nParent: He's had remittent fevers for several months, but all the septic screens came back negative.\nDoctor: Alright. Given the negative screens, it's possible that there may be a central cause related to irregularities in thermoregulation. Has he developed any unusual movements, such as dystonia or dyskinetic movements?\nParent: Yes, he has developed marked dystonia and dyskinetic movements lately.\nDoctor: It seems like there might be involvement of the extrapyramidal nervous system. Has your elder child experienced similar issues, such as epileptic encephalopathy?\nParent: Yes, our elder child had developmental regression and epileptic encephalopathy. He passed away at 1 \u00bd years of age due to aspiration pneumonia while being evaluated for a neuro-metabolic disorder.\nDoctor: I'm very sorry to hear that. During the clinical examination of your younger child, we found severe growth retardation and spasticity in all four limbs, with exaggerated reflexes. The Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed encephalopathy.\nParent: That sounds really concerning, Doctor.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. The Brain MRI showed multiple areas of increased T2 signal intensity with diffusion restriction involving the brain stem, basal ganglia, and white matter tracts, suggesting widespread demyelination. The urine FeCl3 test came back positive for phenylketonuria.\nParent: What does that mean for our child?\nDoctor: Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that could explain some of your child's symptoms. Our tests also showed an elevated Phenylalanine level of 1245.71 \u03bcM, with a normal range being 25-120 \u03bcM, and a Phenylalanine/Tyrosine ratio of 21.87, where the normal range is 0.4-2.2. Additionally, his blood Neopterin levels were very low at 0.01 nmol/g Hb.\nParent: What do these results mean for our son's condition and treatment?\nDoctor: The results indicate a possible metabolic disorder, which could be contributing to your child's symptoms. We'll need to discuss further tests and potential treatment options to manage his condition.

I don't really drink alcohol or use any other drugs, though.\nDoctor: I understand. Unfortunately, you recently suffered an acute thalamomesencephalic stroke which has rapidly worsened, leading you to a comatose state. Your personal medical history and familial history show no association with cardiocerebrovascular pathology or other specific risk factors. \nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible...\nDoctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. On the evening before this cerebral infarction, you had a large tattoo done on your left hypochondrium and abdominal flank, and you smoked a few cigarettes with cannabis.

I got the tattoo and smoked some joints afterward.\nDoctor: The next morning, you experienced acute onset of dizziness, visual, speech, and gait disturbances. Can you describe those symptoms?\nPatient: I was feeling really dizzy, had trouble seeing, speaking, and walking properly.\nDoctor: You were then admitted to the emergency room with walking difficulties, disturbed balance and coordination of movements, slurred speech, diplopia, confusion, and left palpebral ptosis. Our neurological examination revealed right-sided severe ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria, left palpebral ptosis and mydriasis, divergent strabismus, and fluctuating consciousness, with a Glasgow coma scale of 10/15.\nPatient: That sounds really bad...\nDoctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We also conducted blood tests, including white blood cells count, hemoglobin, electrolytes, liver, and renal function, all of which revealed normal results. However, your urine toxicology at admission was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. No other illicit drugs were present on the tox screen. Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X-ray findings were also normal.\nPatient: I see. So, it's just the marijuana that was found in my system?\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. Clotting tests were performed as well, with antithrombin III at 108% (>80%), homocysteine at 7.5 \u03bcmol (\u2264 12), lupus anticoagulant negative, antinuclear antibodies at 0.3 UM (<0.7), and C protein at 117% (70-130).

Can you tell me if you have any past medical history or complications?\nPatient: No, I don't have any past medical issues or complications.\nDoctor: That's good. I see that both your epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase status are negative, and your PD-L1 expression is 0%. Have you already received any treatment for your lung adenocarcinoma?\nPatient: Yes, I've received chemotherapy as the initial treatment because CRT wasn't suitable due to the wide extent and size of the tumor. I was given four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab.\nDoctor: I understand. And after that, you were treated with pemetrexed and bevacizumab as maintenance therapy, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: It looks like your tumor decreased in size once, but then it regrew. However, the tumor size is now smaller than before the initial treatment, which makes CRT possible at this timing. We've decided to perform CRT followed by durvalumab as the next treatment for you on the cancer board.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: CRT was performed one month after your last administration of pemetrexed and bevacizumab. For the large tumor lesions, we prescribed up to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with involved-field radiotherapy to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. The dose was given through parallel-opposed anteroposterior portals up to 30 Gy, and multiportal beams were used to reduce the dose in the spinal cord from 30 to 50 Gy. Weekly carboplatin (area under the curve, 2.0) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) were administered concomitantly.\nPatient: Were there any major adverse events during CRT?\nDoctor: No, there were no major adverse events observed during CRT. One month after CRT, your tumor decreased in size, and there were no new lesions or adverse effects, such as esophagitis and pneumonitis.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Yes, it's positive progress. As a result, we started durvalumab (10 mg/m2, every 2 weeks) after confirming the absence of new lesions and adverse effects.\nPatient: How long will I be on durvalumab?\nDoctor: You'll receive three courses of durvalumab, which will be 2.5 months after the completion of CRT.

I've been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting lately.\nDoctor: I see. We'll need to do a physical examination and run some tests to determine the cause. I'll start with the physical examination. *After examination* Everything seems to be normal with the physical examination. Now, let's review your lab results.\nDoctor: Your lab results show that you have anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit at 32.2%, and lipase at 164 U/L. Your comprehensive metabolic panel is unrevealing, so we performed a CT of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a better look.\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed an enlarged pancreas without a focal mass, diffuse surrounding mesenteric edema, mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy, rectal wall thickening with perirectal lymphadenopathy, left renal mass measuring 3.7 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 1.4 cm, right renal mass measuring 2.3 \u00d7 4.3 \u00d7 5.2 cm, marked diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion. This raised concern for peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or mesenteric tumor.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We wanted to be thorough, so we invited urology and oncology services to evaluate you. They both agreed that a biopsy of the lymph node was necessary, along with urine cytology and HIV testing.\nDoctor: Your urine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes. The renal biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A bone marrow biopsy was also performed and was consistent with involvement of B-cell lymphoma.\nPatient: That's scary. What about the HIV test?\nDoctor: Your HTLV-I/II antibody test came back negative, but your HIV screening was positive. Your initial CD4 count was 440/\u03bcl with a percentage of 14%, and your HIV RNA viral load by PCR was 61,800 copies/mL.\nPatient: Oh no. What about hepatitis?\nDoctor: Your hepatitis C virus screening was negative. Your hepatitis B screening showed that you were positive for the core antibody and surface antibody, but negative for the surface antigen.\nDoctor: Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also above the upper limit of detection for our lab, at >2500 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Finally, the biopsy of your kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for other markers.\nPatient: So, what's the plan, doctor? What do we do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to consult with specialists in oncology and infectious diseases to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will guide us on how to manage both your lymphoma and HIV. We'll also closely monitor your hepatitis B status. Rest assured, we will work together to provide you with the best care possible.",

They found a 5 mm left breast nodule and left axillary adenopathy up to 3.2 cm.\nDoctor: Given the concern for breast cancer, I believe you underwent a core needle biopsy of the left axillary node. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. After the biopsy, I was diagnosed with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nDoctor: I have your immunostaining results here. It shows large atypical cells that were CD30+, CD15+ (subset), CD20+ (strong), and PAX5+. No flow cytometric analysis was performed.

The flow cytometric analysis also showed no evidence of a B- or T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The PET/CT scan from the skull base to the midthigh revealed hypermetabolic adenopathy within the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with the largest area of bulky adenopathy in the left axilla. \nPatient: So, what does all this mean for me, doc?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, it appears that you have classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is a type of cancer. The good news is that there is no evidence of the cancer in your bone marrow. Your oncologist will discuss treatment options and next steps with you.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything to me.

Have you undergone any further tests to investigate the lung nodule?\nPatient: Yes, I underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and a bronchoscopy.\nDoctor: What were the findings from those tests?\nPatient: They found a 9 mm fatty endobronchial lesion in the bronchus intermedius above the middle lobe with a 2 cm extraluminal fatty lesion into the right hilum.\nDoctor: Did they perform any additional procedures like an endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mass?\nPatient: Yes, they did. They found benign bronchial epithelial cells.\nDoctor: That's good news. Since endobronchial resection of the mass would lead to a large defect in the right bronchus intermedius, we decided to perform robotic-assisted resection of the lesion. We used the Da Vinci Xi robot for the procedure. Have you seen the video of the operation?\nPatient: No, I haven't. How did the operation go?\nDoctor: We first performed a right lower lobe superior segmentectomy to get adequate exposure of the hilar mass. We then mobilized the superior segmental branch of the pulmonary artery and divided it with the vascular robot stapler. The same was done for the superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe bronchus.\nPatient: Hmm, alright.\nDoctor: We used indocyanine green angiography to define the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was divided using the robot blue load stapler. This provided access to the hilar fatty tumor, allowing for its removal and subsequent resection of the endobronchial lesion with scissors.\nPatient: Were the lesions cancerous?\nDoctor: No, the frozen section on both lesions was negative for malignancy. We confirmed complete resection with intraoperative bronchoscopy, which also showed a large opening in the airway.\nPatient: So, what's next?\nDoctor: To reconstruct the airway, we placed two 3-0 vicryl stay sutures at the proximal and distal ends of the airway and pulled the airway posteriorly away from the suture line through the posterior ports.\nPatient: I see.

Can you tell me more about the symptoms you experienced?\nPatient: Yeah, I noticed a lump on the left side of my tongue and it was quite painful.\nDoctor: I understand. In your records, it also mentions some comorbidity factors, such as a gastric ulcer in 1983, vein thrombosis in 2016, and smoking and alcohol abuse, which you stopped in 2015. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: In 2017, you were treated with radio-chemotherapy for an invasive carcinoma of the anal canal, stage T3NxM0. How was your recovery from that treatment?\nPatient: It was quite tough, but I managed to get through it.\nDoctor: Good to hear. Now, back to your tongue tumor. Upon examination, it was localized on the submucosal part of the tongue and measured 11 \u00d7 11 mm at MRI (Fig. b). You then had a surgical removal of the tumor (Fig. a). How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: I've been feeling better, but still a bit uneasy about the whole situation.\nDoctor: I understand your concerns. The histological analysis of the specimen showed that the bulk of the tumor was localized in the tongue muscle, and the upper part of the lesion was remaining at 0.5 mm of the basal membrane (Fig. b). The epithelium was normal, without ulceration or intra-epithelial neoplasia. At higher magnification, the tumor corresponded to a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), keratinizing (Fig. c). The stroma presented moderate lymphocytic infiltration, but no vascular or peri-neural invasion was seen. Immunophenotyping revealed a strong p16 labeling (100% of the cells) (Fig. d). The tumor was well limited in the periphery and the surgical margins were clear. \nPatient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor was successfully removed and the surgical margins were clear, which is a good sign. However, considering your previous diagnosis of carcinoma of the anal canal, we compared the histological features of the two tumors and performed complementary virological analyses to check for a possible metastasis to the tongue from the original primary anal tumor.\nPatient: And what did you find?\nDoctor: Both the anal and lingual tumors corresponded to bona fide SCCs (Fig. c, e). The keratinization in the anal carcinoma was less pronounced, and a poorly differentiated component somewhat reminiscent of a basaloid carcinoma was also present, exhibiting necrotic foci. At the upper part of the anal tumor specimen, there was an ulceration edged by lateral extension of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia.\nPatient: So, is there any connection between the two tumors?\nDoctor: Based on the histological analysis and virological tests, it's not clear whether the lingual tumor is a metastasis from the anal carcinoma. However, we will continue to monitor your condition closely to ensure that any potential issues are addressed promptly.\nPatient: I appreciate that, thank you.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Please make sure to attend regular follow-up appointments and notify us if you experience any unusual symptoms.\nPatient: Will do, thank you.",

I understand that your cerebrospinal fluid was collected and a N. meningitidis culture was grown. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yeah, the culture they grew was designated as DuyDNT, and it was identified to belong to serogroup B.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that you recovered successfully after treatment. Now, on the topic of the DuyDNT isolate, it has been revealed to be a novel sequence type. It was assigned an ST 13074 by PubMLST, a public database that catalogs genetic data and isolate provenance of the Neisseria genus. Did you know that?\nPatient: No, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: By sequencing the seven housekeeping genes used in the MLST scheme, every N. meningitidis isolate can be assigned a sequence type (ST) and placed into groups and clonal complexes based on evolutionary relatedness. Besides DuyDNT, only two other isolates of ST 13074 have been found, both were carrier strains identified in Vietnam in 2017. ST 13074 shared \u2265 5 identical alleles at seven typed loci with three other STs (1576, 11013, and 13455), making it the central ST of this group by PubMLST group's definition.\nPatient: Oh, I see. That's interesting.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. Now, moving forward, it's essential that you continue monitoring your health and reporting any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider. Keep up with any required follow-up appointments, and take care of yourself.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep an eye on my health and follow your advice.",

I had a smoke habit of 60 cigarettes per day for 30 years until 1999 and consumed 150 grams of alcohol per day until I quit in 1999.\nDoctor: Yes, I see that you were diagnosed with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) in the right side of the floor of your mouth (pTis pN0 M0) in July 1999. You were surgically treated with tumor exeresis, functional bilateral supramilohid lymphadenectomy, reconstruction with microvascular free radial flap, and tracheostomy. How did the postoperative period go?\nPatient: I had a cervical hematoma that appeared after the surgery, and it had to be surgically debrided. I also received internal radiation with brachytherapy, which was a total dose of 50 Gy.\nDoctor: In 2000, you had a second OSCC arising in the soft palate and latero-cervical area (pT1 pN2b M0). It was detected and treated by local excision with direct repair and a radical lymphadenectomy. Were there any complications during the postoperative period?\nPatient: No, there were no complications that time.\nDoctor: I see that you underwent a second radiotherapy with external radiation. You received a total dose of 60 Gy in the tumor site, 50 Gy in the supraclavicular field, 60 Gy in the spinal lymphatic right chains, and 50 Gy in the left chains, with 2 Gy per fraction. Did you experience any side effects from this treatment?\nPatient: Yes, I had Mucositis and epithelitis GII grade as toxicity consequences of the radiation.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. In 2017, a third OSCC was located on your left buccal mucosa (T2 N0 M0), which was treated with tumor resection. Did you have radiotherapy for this one as well?\nPatient: No, I didn't have radiotherapy for that one. The defect was reconstructed with a radial microsurgical graft.\nDoctor: I see that you experienced a vein thrombosis of the pedicle during the postoperative period. How was this complication addressed?\nPatient: It was solved with a new vein anastomosis.\nDoctor: Currently, you're undergoing treatment for prostate cancer with external radiotherapy. How is that going?\nPatient: It's going okay, just trying to manage the side effects.\nDoctor: I also see that you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Is this being managed properly?\nPatient: Yes, I'm taking medication for it and monitoring my levels.\nDoctor: That's good to hear.

Were these procedures done using a retrograde transaortic approach?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: So, the ablation strategy was based on a substrate-guided approach and pace-mapping due to the noninducibility of the clinical VT. How did you feel after these procedures?\nPatient: Unfortunately, I kept suffering from several recurrences of VT, and I even experienced three arrhythmic storms with a cycle length of 460 ms.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that.

Do you know the overall number of appropriate shocks since the implantation?\nPatient: I think it's been up to 97 shocks since the implantation.\nDoctor: During your fourth hospital admission in January 2014, a 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm and premature ventricular contraction originating from the mid-inferoseptum of the left ventricle. Did you experience any symptoms at that time?\nPatient: Not really, I just felt a little off.\nDoctor: At the same time, a transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal biventricular systolic function and mild-to-moderate mitral valve regurgitation.

Have you experienced any similar issues in the past?\nPatient: I developed severe depression when I was 18, which caused me to take medical leave from my freshman year of college. Since then, I've been on numerous psychotropic medications. At the time of admission, I was on an extensive and complex regimen.\nDoctor: It must have been tough for you. How has your depression been since then?\nPatient: My mother and I both agree that my depression has been relentless and difficult to treat.\nDoctor: I understand that you've been seeing different doctors and have been prescribed various medications. Can you tell me more about that experience?\nPatient: It was awful. I left my university and spent my freshman year in bed or at doctors' offices. No one knew what was wrong with me, so they kept referring me to different doctors and prescribing more medicines to treat the symptoms. The psych docs sent me to the medical docs and the medical docs sent me to the psych! It was the most frustrating, upsetting, and debilitating year of my life.\nDoctor: I can imagine how frustrating that must have been. I see that you had genetic testing done at 4 years old and it was found that you carried an FMR1 premutation. Your older brother has fragile X syndrome, and your mother and aunt also carry the FMR1 premutation. Have you experienced any other related health issues?\nPatient: My mother and aunt both experienced premature menopause. I started menstruating at age 11, but never had regular periods.\nDoctor: Did you take any medication for your menstrual issues?\nPatient: I began taking oral contraceptives at age 13 due to debilitating dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. I stopped taking them when I was 16.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing all this information with me. I'll review your medical history and test results and come up with a plan to address your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. We'll work together to find the right treatment for you.",

On admission, your body temperature was 36.9 \u00b0C, your heart rate was 96 beats/minute, and your blood pressure was 148/68 mmHg. Your physical and neurological examinations were not significant. I also noticed that your past medical history includes appendectomy at the age of 8 and lumbar canal stenosis at the age of 70. You don't smoke cigarettes but drink Japanese alcohol (360 ml/day). Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Regarding your family history, I see that your elder brother passed away due to esophageal cancer. \nPatient: Yes, that's true.\nDoctor: On ICU day 5, you developed a new onset fever up to 38.0 \u00b0C, an increase in sputum, and hypoxemia with 90% arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry. You were receiving mask oxygen at 10 L/minute. Did you experience any difficulty breathing or chest discomfort?\nPatient: Yeah, I had trouble breathing and I heard some crackling sounds in my chest.\nDoctor: That's consistent with the bilateral pulmonary coarse crackles we observed. Due to these symptoms, you were intubated. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates predominantly in your right lung with pleural effusion. \nPatient: That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Yes, it is a concerning finding. After intubation, your laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 5.7 \u00d7 109/L, red blood cell count of 2.25 \u00d7 1012/L, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 21.4%, platelet 145 \u00d7 109/L, aspartate aminotransferase 54 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 55 U/L, total bilirubin 4.11 mg/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, urea nitrogen 38 mg/dL, creatinine 0.83 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 18.7 mg/dL, and urinary creatinine 95 mg/dL. \nPatient: What does all that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate an infection. Your sputum culture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae, so we changed your antibiotic from cefmetazole to meropenem on ICU day 7.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: You underwent a long period of mechanical ventilation and eventually had a tracheostomy on ICU day 38. Your oxygenation was good, with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) greater than 300 mmHg.\nPatient: So, what's next for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as necessary. Our goal is to help you recover and transition out of the ICU.

We've done a clinical examination and found a hard mass protruding through your right nostril. Your laboratory parameters, including alkaline phosphatase levels, are normal.\nPatient: Oh, that's concerning. What's next?\nDoctor: We performed a CT scan of your nasal cavity to get a better look at the mass. The examination showed enlargement of the posterior aspect of the basal lamella due to a mass with non-homogeneous areas of calcification.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means that the mass is occupying most of your mid-nasal cavity, displacing the inferior turbinate and extending into the nasal vestibule. To treat this, you underwent endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So the mass was removed?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed a complete excision of the mass.

However, during the Ishihara color vision testing, you were able to identify only ten out of fifteen plates in your right eye and eleven out of fifteen plates in your left eye. This indicates a diminished color vision.\nPatient: Oh, I see. That's a bit concerning.\nDoctor: It's important to keep an eye on it, but don't panic. I also noticed that your right eye had received laser retinopexy after a posterior vitreous detachment for symptomatic retinal holes associated with lattice degeneration. How has your vision been since that procedure?\nPatient: My vision has been stable since the retinopexy, no significant changes.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Overall, your visual health seems to be stable, but we will continue to monitor it closely. It's essential to keep up with regular eye exams and report any new visual changes or concerns to your healthcare team. As of now, there doesn't seem to be a direct connection between your hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and your visual complaints.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me about any other medical conditions you've had since then?\nPatient: Yes, I was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 2006, which was treated with chemotherapy. I also have a history of psychiatric illness and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Your maintenance immunosuppressive treatment consists of tacrolimus and prednisone, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Good. Now, since 2014, your routine control exams have shown slight intermittent transaminase elevation, which we suspect may be due to alcohol consumption. In August 2016, you presented with ascites and laboratory evidence of graft dysfunction. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any other symptoms, such as encephalopathy?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any signs of encephalopathy.\nDoctor: Okay, that's good to know. Your liver function tests showed moderately elevated transaminases and some degree of cholestasis. We also ruled out hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and cytomegalovirus infections. Your Epstein-Barr virus levels are within the usual range for you.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: Your serology results showed positive anti-HEV IgM and IgG, as well as positive PCR for HEV RNA in plasma. This indicates an infection with rabbit HEV, genotype 3ra. We also confirmed this diagnosis by finding positive HEV RNA in a stored serum sample from 2014.\nPatient: So, I have chronic hepatitis E?\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. Your graft cirrhosis has decompensated due to chronic hepatitis E. We have adjusted your tacrolimus levels to around 2 \u03bcg/l, along with your usual prednisone dose of 5 mg qd. However, your HEV RNA levels did not decrease, so we introduced ribavirin in September 2016.\nPatient: How has that affected my liver function tests?\nDoctor: Your liver function tests have improved since starting ribavirin. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Be sure to follow up with me regularly so that we can keep track of your condition and make any necessary changes to your treatment.

They found that you had anemia with a hemoglobin of 11 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46,000 per microliter, and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.33 mg/dL, which is elevated from your normal baseline. Additionally, they found elevated lactate dehydrogenase at 968 IU/L, decreased haptoglobin at 15 mg/dL, and a peripheral blood smear showing one to two schistocytes per high power field. Based on these findings, they presumed you have TTP and started you on treatment.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. What is TTP?\nDoctor: TTP stands for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. It's a rare blood disorder that can cause blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout your body. They sent an ADAMTS13 test, which is used to diagnose TTP, and we're still waiting for the results.\nPatient: I see.

You denied any weight loss, fever, bleeding or bruising, dyspnea, or urinary symptoms. Is that still the case?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: You mentioned using occasional ethanol, but denied any smoking or drug use history. You also denied recent travel or risk factors for HIV.

I've been admitted to the hospital 5 times in the past 4 years because of it.\nDoctor: I see. It looks like you were transferred to an acute treatment ward from a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU).

However, one week after the transfer, your mental state suddenly deteriorated. You became very agitated and verbally and physically aggressive. Can you describe the behavior you exhibited during that time?\nPatient: Yeah, I started acting really weird. I would stop and stand still for a few minutes, and then suddenly start running fast along the ward corridor. I also had more intense auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and thought disorganization.\nDoctor: It seems that you also developed a fear of the hospital ward's electronic fire alarms, believing they were cameras spying on you. You were preoccupied with specific members of the staff whom you thought were there to kill you. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I was really scared of those alarms and certain staff members.\nDoctor: Your hallucinations became more severe, and you were responding to internal stimuli constantly throughout the day. At that point, your total PANSS score increased to 109/210, and your UDS was positive for SCRAs. To manage your agitated behavior and psychotic symptoms, we decided to increase your Olanzapine dosage to 20 mg daily and add Clonazepam 8 mg daily. We also increased the level of monitoring of your vital measures by completing the NEWS scores twice a day. Is that okay with you?\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\nDoctor: Your NEWS score indicated a 2 with increased heart rate and fluctuating blood pressure. We will continue to closely monitor your vital signs and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It's important for you to report any changes in your symptoms or if you experience any side effects from the medications.\nPatient: Alright, I'll make sure to let you guys know if anything changes or if I have any concerns.\nDoctor: Great.

In some cases, we may find spear-shaped hyperechoic structures with varying sizes. These could be causing the inflammation and discharge. We might also see a hypoechoic halo, which could indicate the presence of inflammatory fluid.\nPatient: And if you find something like that, what's the next step?\nDoctor: If we identify a foreign body, we'll proceed to anesthetize your dog and remove the object.

There is no ASD, but the right atrium and right ventricle are dilated. We will need to perform a CTPA to help us define the anatomy more clearly.\nPatient: Alright, Doctor. Please go ahead.\n(After the CTPA)\nDoctor: The CTPA results confirm our preliminary diagnosis of isolated left-sided PAPVC. The left pulmonary veins are joining to form a common channel and draining into the superior vena cava via the left brachiocephalic vein, which is suggestive of left supracardiac PAPVC.\nPatient: What does that mean, Doctor?\nDoctor: This means that your son will need to be surgically managed to correct the issue.

The right atrium and the right ventricle will also appear dilated. The vertical vein will be seen opening into the innominate vein, and the left pulmonary veins will be seen opening into the vertical vein. We will operate without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support.\nPatient: I see. What will you do next?\nDoctor: We will make a 15 mm opening in the common chamber horizontally after applying a Cooley's clamp. Another opening of similar dimensions will be made over the left atrial appendage. The vertical vein will then be anastomosed to the left atrial appendage posteriorly with 6-0 prolene in a side-to-side fashion. We will then ligate the vertical vein-innominate confluence at the end of the procedure.\nPatient: Will he be okay after the surgery?\nDoctor: Yes, he will require mechanical ventilation for about 12 hours after the surgery. But, he should recover uneventfully and be discharged on Day 10.\nPatient: That's a relief. Thank you, Doctor.",

To resolve this problem, we performed a TEP (totally extraperitoneal) procedure using mesh and a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate). How are you feeling now?\nPatient: I'm feeling okay, but there's some discomfort in my groin area.\nDoctor: Alright, let me explain what we did during the surgery. First, we obtained laparoscopic transperitoneal access to minimize the risk of infection during the transurethral resection of your prostate. Then, we repaired your bilateral hernia with laparoscopy by reducing the hernia sac and placing a prosthetic mesh inlay. The mesh used for closing the defect was made of polypropylene.\nPatient: Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining that.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We also gave you preoperative and postoperative single doses of levofloxacin to further reduce the risk of infection. The laparoscopic procedures of TEP and TURP were done without any difficulties, and the total operating time was 3 hours with an estimated blood loss of 100 cc. \nPatient: Okay, that's good to know.\nDoctor: Before the surgery, we did a pathological examination that showed atypical adenomatous hyperplasia with chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. Your PSA level was also high at 29 ng/ml. In the third week after your surgery, we found a hematoma in your right inguinal area. Did you notice any pain or swelling there?\nPatient: Yes, I did feel some pain and noticed swelling in that area.\nDoctor: We performed an ultrasound examination and found fluid collection in that area. Unfortunately, at your three-month postoperative follow-up, we discovered that you had developed bilateral inguinal abscess and sepsis. We then performed a CT scan, which showed an irregularly shaped mass and prostate. \nPatient: That sounds serious. What did you do to treat it?\nDoctor: We conducted an evacuation and debridement laparotomy to treat the inguinal abscess and address the issues caused by the previous laparoscopic surgery. At your next follow-up, we found no evidence of hernia recurrence after the mesh evacuation.\nPatient: I'm glad to hear that. What should I do now to ensure proper healing and prevent complications?\nDoctor: It's important to keep the surgical area clean and follow all postoperative care instructions. If you notice any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or increased pain, please contact me immediately. Additionally, make sure to attend all follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress and address any issues that may arise.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I'll follow your advice and keep an eye on my recovery.\nDoctor: You're welcome, and feel free to contact me if you have any concerns or questions throughout your recovery. Take care!",

Have you noticed any unusual bruising or bleeding?\nPatient: Hmm, not really, just the pain and swelling in my leg.\nDoctor: All right. We've been monitoring your laboratory findings, and there's one issue we need to address. You have thrombocytopenia, which means your platelet counts are low. They've dropped from 320x109/L to 8x109/L in EDTA.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: No, it's a concern. We tried giving you three full-dose platelet transfusions over the last two days, but your platelet counts didn't increase. There were no accompanying flags or blood smears mentioned in your medical chart.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now?\nDoctor: A consultant anesthesiologist suspected PTCP, so we took a blood sample in EDTA, sodium citrate, and heparin. Your platelet counts were 13x109/L in EDTA, but 355x109/L in sodium citrate and 310x109/L in heparin. Thrombocytopenia and platelet aggregates were flagged only in the EDTA aliquot.\nPatient: What does that mean, doc?\nDoctor: It means we found abnormal platelet histogram and white blood cell counts, suggesting in vitro platelet clumping. This could be causing the low platelet counts in the EDTA sample.\nPatient: I see. So what's the next step?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, your leg is deemed beyond salvage.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: I'm not really sure about the details, but I had a biopsy done that confirmed the diagnosis.\nDoctor: Okay, let's take a look at your imaging results. Your preoperative imaging shows an enlarged liver with multifocal disease throughout the hepatic parenchyma. The lesions show peripheral enhancement with central hypoattenuation on arterial phase and appear isodense to the liver parenchyma on delayed phase imaging. Some of the masses also have calcifications. There hasn't been a significant interval change in size in the 10 months since your initial diagnosis. No chest or pelvic masses were identified during the preoperative workup. \nPatient: Hmm, that sounds complicated. What does it all mean?\nDoctor: It means that there are multiple areas of disease in your liver with various characteristics. The fact that there hasn't been a significant change in size over the past 10 months is a positive sign. Let's talk about the pathologic examination of your liver. It revealed multiple tan discrete nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, involving the bilateral lobes. \nPatient: What does that mean for my condition?\nDoctor: The examination showed two main histologic patterns. One subset of the nodules contained well-formed vascular channels and scattered cords of tumor cells embedded in a sclerotic hyalinized matrix. Other areas of the tumor were characterized by small, irregular central hyalinized scars containing subtle foci of neoplastic cells and a mild bile ductular reaction.\nPatient: What about the other findings?\nDoctor: On high magnification, the tumor cells exhibited mild cytologic atypia and were characterized by abundant pale cytoplasm, nuclei bearing open chromatin, and visible though not large nucleoli. Scattered intracytoplasmic vacuoles were noted in the tumor cells arranged in a linear pattern. Mitotic figures were not observed; however, focal vascular invasion by single tumor cells was noted. There was also stromal lymphocytic inflammation and focal calcification in one of the lesions. The surrounding liver parenchyma had a nodular architecture, reminiscent of focal nodular hyperplasia.\nPatient: And what about the immunohistochemical results?\nDoctor: Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed an endothelial phenotype with strong expression of CD31 and ERG. The tumor nuclei were also positive for TFE3 but not for CAMTA1.\nPatient: So, what does all this mean for my treatment and prognosis?\nDoctor: This information helps us better understand the nature of your liver masses and guides us in determining the most appropriate course of treatment, which in this case is transplantation. Your prognosis will depend on how well your body responds to the transplantation and any necessary follow-up treatments. We will closely monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your explanation and guidance throughout this process.",

Medical records from another facility show that the PEG tube and VP shunt catheter were in normal positions one year prior.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Given the malposition of the VP shunt inside your gastric lumen, we suspected a possible VP shunt infection or meningitis/encephalitis. We performed a lumbar puncture, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis came back unremarkable. Thankfully, your blood cultures and urine culture results were also negative.\nPatient: That's a relief, I guess.\nDoctor: However, your wound culture tested positive for Proteus mirabilis, which is sensitive to carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to your long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Your treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I see that you eventually underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. How has your recovery been from that surgery?\nPatient: It's been okay, but I still have some pain from time to time.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Now, regarding your recent bleeding, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.\nDoctor: Your most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon, with pathology confirming tubular adenoma. Your physical examination today showed mild left-sided abdominal tenderness, but was otherwise unremarkable. Your rectal examination showed nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to your baseline. Your creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. Your international normalized ratio was 2.0. Due to the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, we decided to admit you to the hospital for further evaluation. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\nDoctor: You underwent a colonoscopy which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated lesion. We'll be discussing your case with a team of specialists to determine the best course of action for your treatment. In the meantime, please let me or the nursing staff know if you experience any changes in your symptoms or if you have any questions.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

I've been experiencing hypesthesia from my right lower lip to the mental region, so I decided to consult a hospital for the first visit.\nDoctor: I see. Have you undergone any tests or examinations for this issue?\nPatient: Yes, I had a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a round radiolucent area in my right mandibular body. After that, a biopsy was carried out, and I was diagnosed with schwannoma.\nDoctor: I understand. You've been referred to our Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery here at Gunma University Hospital for a detailed examination and treatment. Let's discuss your current physical and nutritional status. How do you feel overall?\nPatient: I think my physical status is moderate, and my nutritional status is favorable. There's no other notable factor, I believe.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We also conducted a visual inspection, and there was no tumor lesion found in your oral cavity. We did, however, note hypesthesia extending from your right lower lip to the mental region, with the perception level being approximately 50% of that on the unaffected side. The CT imaging showed dilation of the mandibular canal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregular high signal intensity on horizontal sections of short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR). On sagittal sections, dilation of the right mandibular canal was observed around the mandibular foramen. Dynamic images showed crescendo enhancement.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. So, what do the preoperative biopsy findings suggest?\nDoctor: The biopsy findings from the first hospital you visited suggest a schwannoma involving the Antoni A region. Briefly, the lesion is immature, which means there's an active potential for future tumor growth.\nPatient: I see. So, what's the plan for treatment?\nDoctor: Considering the risk of future tumor growth, we decided to extirpate the tumor under general anesthesia in late April 2015. During the surgery, we found a cystic tumor (3.2 \u00d7 1.0 cm) associated with the inferior alveolar nerve and vessels. As a result, the inferior alveolar nerve was ligated, cut, and extirpated as a mass.\nPatient: And what about the results of the surgery?\nDoctor: Intraoperative rapid diagnosis confirmed the absence of tumor cells at the margins of the resected nerve specimen, which is a positive sign. During your 2-year postoperative follow-up, we observed radiopacity enhanced at the wound site after extirpation of the tumor, confirming favorable bone outgrowth.\nPatient: That's a relief. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your progress and make sure your recovery goes smoothly.

There was no evidence of acute stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or intracranial metastasis. These findings are suggestive of PRES.\nPatient: Hmm, what does that mean?\nDoctor: The multidisciplinary tumor board committee decided that PRES could be attributed to the toxic effect of trastuzumab or your hypertension. We discharged you on levetiracetam with a plan to continue trastuzumab, strictly control your blood pressure, and repeat the MRI in three months.\nPatient: Okay, so how was my blood pressure during that time?\nDoctor: During that period, your blood pressure was controlled on multiple encounters with all readings being < 140/90.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: A repeated brain MRI with and without contrast revealed persistent T2-FLAIR hyperintensity in the occipital and posterior parietal lobes, still suggestive of PRES.

I also received two cycles of chemotherapy with Ifosfamide and Epirubicin. But the disease locally progressed.\nDoctor: It seems that your oncologists decided to perform preoperative radiotherapy and a second, more radical surgical intervention the following year. Were there any recurrences after that?\nPatient: Yes, until the end of 2014, I was stable. But in 2015 and 2016, I had to be treated again for local relapses with limb-sparing surgeries, including a left femoro-popliteal bypass.\nDoctor: I understand. After these surgeries, did the disease progress any further?\nPatient: Unfortunately, yes. The disease distantly progressed with a pulmonary metastatic spread. I was then treated with four high-dose, neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles of Ifosfamide.\nDoctor: Did you have a complete response to the chemotherapy?\nPatient: No, the lung lesions decreased but didn't completely disappear. In August 2017, I underwent microwave ablation for the four larger lung lesions to control the disease.\nDoctor: It looks like in October 2017, a control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your left leg and knee showed a new local relapse. Can you tell me about the symptoms you experienced?\nPatient: I noticed two pathologic nodules near the scars on my calf and soleus muscle. My doctor confirmed them with an ultrasound examination.\nDoctor: Due to your previous therapies, surgical excision was considered not feasible. The first proposed treatment option was leg amputation. What did you decide to do?\nPatient: I refused the leg amputation. My oncologist, radiation oncologist, and interventional radiologist decided to attempt treatment with PLA under US-guidance to avoid a major amputation.\nDoctor: That's a reasonable decision. How has the treatment been working for you?\nPatient: So far, it seems to be helping. I'm just hoping I can avoid the amputation.\nDoctor: It's important to follow up with your oncologist and radiation oncologist regularly to monitor your progress.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Alright, let me explain what we did to treat this condition. We removed a minimal amount of bone, about 3 mm, from the vomer which is located posterior to the vomeroperpendicular suture (VPS).

What kind of issues have you been experiencing?\nPatient: I've been having trouble breathing and needed more oxygen in the past few months. It's been getting worse.\nDoctor: That's concerning. Let's perform an EKG to monitor your QTc and see if there's any issue with your heart. *After performing the EKG* It looks like you have a new-onset atrial bigeminy. We'll need to send you to the emergency department for further evaluation.\nPatient: Oh, alright. What's going to happen there?\nDoctor: They'll do telemetry and another EKG to see if the arrhythmia has resolved. Based on your complaints of worsening dyspnea, they may also perform a CT-angiogram of your pulmonary arteries to rule out any pulmonary embolism.\n*At the emergency department*\nDoctor: Your telemetry and EKG showed resolution of the arrhythmia, which is good news. The CT-angiogram, however, revealed a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) involving the pulmonary vein in your left upper lobe and lingula, returning blood to your right atrium through the left brachiocephalic vein. We also performed an echocardiogram, which ruled out an atrial septal defect but showed a mildly dilated right ventricle, mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, and normal left ventricular function.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds complicated. Is it related to my other health issues?\nDoctor: It could be. You have morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and a history of acute lymphocytic leukemia with a bone marrow transplant and graft-versus-host disease. These conditions have caused severe restrictive lung disease, with reduced lung capacity and function. Your total lung capacity is at 42%, FEV1 at 39%, FVC at 37%, and DLCO at 41% of predicted values. You're also using two liters of oxygen supplementation at home and have a functional capacity of four metabolic equivalents (METS).\nPatient: That's not good. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We performed a right and left heart catheterization to evaluate the shunt. The results revealed pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 52 mmHg, diastolic pressure of 43 mmHg, mean pressure of 40 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance of 1.7 Wood Units, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 mmHg, and cardiac output (Fick) of 7.47 L/min. The shunt-index, or pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs), is 1.22:1.\nPatient: What does all of that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means we need to closely monitor your condition and consider further treatment options.

Can you tell me a little more about his medical history?\nParent: Sure, doctor. He doesn't have a pathological perinatal history, nor any personal or family history of atopy.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Has he had any choking episodes or swallowed a foreign body that you're aware of?\nParent: No, we haven't witnessed any choking episodes, and he's never had any dysphagia.\nDoctor: I see. How long has he been experiencing these symptoms?\nParent: Well, during the last month before his admission, he had repeated attacks of cough and wheezing, but no dysphagia or drooling.\nDoctor: What treatments has he received so far?\nParent: He was given antibiotics and steroids for a month to treat suspected asthma, but his cough got progressively worse. The appearance of dyspnea is what motivated us to come for an emergency consultation.\nDoctor: Let me share the results of the examination with you. Your child was conscious and without cyanosis. He had a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C, a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, an oxygen saturation of 93%, and no signs of dehydration or malnutrition. His pulmonary examination showed suprasternal recession, scattered snoring, and diffuse wheeze. The cardiovascular examination was normal, and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nDoctor: We also conducted blood tests, which showed a normal complete blood count and a C-reactive protein of 14 mg/l. However, an anteroposterior chest X-ray revealed a foreign body in the upper region of the mediastinum.\nParent: Oh, no! What did you do about it?\nDoctor: We extracted the foreign body through a hypopharyngoscopy under sedation. It turned out to be a clothing button from the upper thoracic esophagus. The mucosa around the button was irregular, but there was no obvious stricture or perforation.\nParent: That's a relief. What's the plan for his recovery?\nDoctor: We maintained your son on intravenous fluids and corticosteroids to decrease the periesophageal inflammation. He was discharged at 24 hours, and there were no clinical signs indicative of a perforation. The following day, he was started on a clear liquid diet.\nParent: How has he been doing since then?\nDoctor: Over the ensuing year, your child has been well and gaining weight satisfactorily. There have been no reports of subsequent hospital attendances related to this episode.\nParent: That's great to hear! Thank you so much for taking care of our son. We really appreciate it.\nDoctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!",

Recently, I've been experiencing respiratory distress and worsening of my cough.\nDoctor: I see. Let's do a physical examination to check your lungs. *listens to patient's lungs* I can hear bilateral fine crackles in your lungs, which could be a sign of something serious. We should perform a CT scan and some blood tests to get a better understanding of your condition.\nPatient: Okay, doctor. Let's do those tests.\n*After the tests*\nDoctor: The CT scan showed new ground-glass opacity over a broad range of bilateral lung fields. This, along with your comparatively poor blood oxygen concentration, indicates that you have an acute exacerbation of your IPF, also known as AE-IPF. Your blood test also showed a high PT antibody titer of 104 EU/mL on day 13 of admission.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: It means we need to adjust your treatment plan. We'll increase your LTOT dosage to help manage your symptoms. Fortunately, you responded well to the clinical treatment, so you'll be able to be discharged to your home.\nPatient: That's a relief. Is there anything else I should know or do?\nDoctor: Yes, it's important to note that you didn't receive any pertussis vaccination since adolescence. Although you have a typical usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution CT, we didn't find any signs of autoimmune disease through blood tests or physical findings. You mentioned having a chronic cough associated with your IPF, but you also reported uncontrolled cough deterioration and continuous cough beginning about 3 weeks before hospitalization.\nPatient: That's correct.\nDoctor: We weren't able to detect Bordetella pertussis from your sputum, and PCR analysis wasn't performed. However, no other infectious diseases or causative bacteria were found through sputum culture tests, serum markers, or urine antigen tests. Moreover, no heart failure was observed.\nPatient: So, what's the plan moving forward?\nDoctor: We're going to treat you with macrolides and broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, along with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. This should help manage your condition, which is a recurrent acute exacerbation.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Please follow the treatment plan and let me know if you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns. Take care!",

You've been presented to the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program. We've followed emergency protocols and placed two large-bore (16 gauge) intravenous cannulas and started a standard saline infusion to treat your descending blood pressure. Your initial examination showed a Glasgow Coma Scale Score of 15, and a quick neurological exam revealed no deficits in your extremities.\nPatient: Okay. So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means your muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and cranial nerve function appear normal. However, we couldn't assess your gait due to your fatigue and the emergency condition. We also have your clinical laboratory values at admission.\nPatient: Alright. I'm currently taking VA, 1500 mg daily. I take 500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening.\nDoctor: I see that you started taking VA four months prior after trials with other medications failed due to adverse effects, such as diarrhea caused by lithium. After starting VA, you were monitored via follow-up examinations in the clinic on a monthly basis. On your second-month visit, you reported concerns of weakness and fatigue. Laboratory tests revealed elevated ammonia and VA levels. At that time, you were diagnosed with VA-induced hyperammonemia.\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. They stopped the VA treatment and started me on lactulose syrup and lamotrigine.\nDoctor: We monitored you weekly after that. After your third weekly visit, you reported concerns of worsening manic symptoms and severe bullae and rashes on your chest. We stopped the lamotrigine, and the manic symptoms recurred, leading to reinstating the VA treatment with weekly follow-up monitoring.\nPatient: So, what's the plan now?\nDoctor: Your ammonia levels have been elevated on all follow-up visits. We've added a daily combination of lactulose syrup and levocarnitine to your treatment regimen during each weekly visit, but your ammonia levels continued to be high.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What can we do about that?\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your ammonia levels and adjust your treatment as necessary.

Your ECG showed a sinus bradycardia with global T wave inversion and the presence of a subtle U wave.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Hypokalemia means you have low levels of potassium in your blood, which can cause muscle weakness and affect your heart's electrical activity, as seen in your ECG results. We will start you on intravenous potassium supplementation at the rate of 20 meq/hour to address this issue.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.

Let me review your medical history. It seems you underwent direct bypass surgery for an intraventricular hemorrhage when you were 50 years old. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Okay, let's take a look at your follow-up DSA results. It shows that the bypass is supplying about 2/3 of your MCA territory. However, there's a \"blank\" area in the temporal and parietal region. This could be causing your current symptoms.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means that the blood flow in that area may not be sufficient. Additionally, your dural neoangiogenesis appears to be poor, which means new blood vessels aren't forming as well as they should.\nPatient: Is that a serious issue, Doctor?\nDoctor: It could potentially lead to further complications. In fact, you experienced a recurrent bleeding 17 months after your surgery, which could be related to these issues.\nPatient: Oh, that's concerning.

This indicates that you have tuberculosis.\nPatient: Oh my, that's concerning.\nDoctor: Based on the tests, we've found a lesion with a stenosis rate of 90% at the entrance of your middle lobar bronchus. To treat this, we administered a local spray with triamcinolone acetonide for 1 week, 2 times in total.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We have been monitoring your condition for a follow-up period of 2 months. There has been an improvement in the narrowing of the bronchial lumen due to the ulceration of the protruding granulation that was covered with a white coat.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: However, it seems like you couldn't tolerate the bronchoscopy procedure.

She was presented to the emergency department for urinary retention, is that correct?\nAdoptive Parent: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I understand that she was born at 35 weeks gestation in Mexico, with an unknown postnatal hospital course. Is there anything else I should know about her birth or early development?\nAdoptive Parent: Well, she was diagnosed with mild gross motor developmental delay several months ago. She can pull herself to stand, but she doesn't cruise or walk yet. She also babbles but doesn't have any words.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Does she have any past medical history, previous surgeries, or known trauma?\nAdoptive Parent: No, she doesn't have any of those.\nDoctor: I see. Upon presentation, you mentioned that she has been living with you since very early in her life. Can you tell me more about her recent history?\nAdoptive Parent: Sure. We've noticed that for the past two weeks, she's been fussy and has had decreased ability to bear weight on her lower extremities. We don't know of any trauma that could have caused this.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I noticed that her weight is less than the 3rd percentile with a Z score of -3.36. She appears thin but without signs of dehydration or malnourishment. During the examination, we found that she has 0/5 strength, hypotonia, and areflexia in her bilateral lower extremities, as well as hypotonia of the trunk. Additionally, she has significant head lag and very severe thoracic kyphosis, or gibbus deformity. \nAdoptive Parent: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is concerning. The patient was first evaluated by outpatient urology after a referral from her primary care office for urinary retention. A renal ultrasound was performed, which showed bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and bladder distension. She was then sent to the emergency department for further workup.\nAdoptive Parent: I see. What were the results of the laboratory studies?\nDoctor: The lab studies in the emergency department showed a normal creatinine level for her age at 0.3 mg/dl. The urine culture obtained by bladder catheterization grew over 100,000 CFU/mL of Enterococcus faecalis. Her complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable, and her thyroid stimulating hormone was within the normal range. However, her creatinine kinase was greater than 1200 U/L, which is six times the upper limit of normal.\nAdoptive Parent: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It indicates that there might be some muscle damage or inflammation. We also performed a spinal CT, which demonstrated a complete retrospondylolisthesis of the T12 vertebra. An MRI was also done and showed marked compression of the spinal cord, resulting in the inability to visualize the cord at the level of T12.\nAdoptive Parent: What are the next steps for her treatment?\nDoctor: We will need to consult with a team of specialists to determine the best course of action for her condition. This may include further testing, medications, or possible surgical intervention. We will keep you informed throughout the process and work together to ensure the best possible outcome for your daughter.",

What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We will schedule you for a two-stage revision surgery, which includes implant removal and antibiotic-loaded spacer implantation. We will withhold antibiotic therapy for now, as your clinical parameters are stable and non-septic. This will allow us to better evaluate potential antibiotic sensitivities following surgical removal of the infected prosthesis.\nPatient: Okay. What can I do for pain management until the surgery?\nDoctor: I will prescribe you celecoxib and metamizole to be taken orally, as well as subcutaneous antithrombotic prophylaxis with enoxaparin sodium. I also recommend following the RICE protocol - rest, ice, compression, and elevation - until your surgery.\nPatient: Alright, thank you.

Let's discuss the results of your recent gynaecological examination. Your external genitalia and vagina appeared normal, and we noticed two cervical orifices in an anteroposterior disposition.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We confirmed this with curetting of the posterior canal, which showed normal endocervical mucosa. This also helped to exclude other pathologies such as uterovaginal or cervicovaginal fistulae. Menstrual blood was observed exiting both cervical orifices.\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: We also performed a Hysterosalpingography (HSG) which revealed a normal uterine cavity and tubes. However, we did see contrast exiting the posterior endocervical canal.\nPatient: Hmm, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It just means that there's a slight difference in the way the contrast exits, but it's not something to be concerned about. We also conducted a transvaginal ultrasound which showed a normal retroverted uterus, with one internal cervical OS and two endocervical canals diverging from it in an anteroposterior arrangement.\nPatient: So, do I need any more tests?\nDoctor: Since both of these exams did not suggest any uterine cavity defects, we decided not to pursue further tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or hysteroscopy.\nPatient: Why not?\nDoctor: These tests can be quite bothersome and invasive for the patient, and in your case, the results would not alter our clinical conduct.

You also have a history of old orthopedic instrumentation from 30 years ago.\nPatient: Yeah, that's right.\nDoctor: We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed pneumocephalus and an incidental finding of a right frontal intra-axial mass with aggressive perilesional edema. We've been managing your condition conservatively with dehydrating measures, antibiotics, and prophylactic antiepileptic medications. Your complete investigations also showed a fracture of your maxilla and mandible.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is important that we monitor your condition closely. Two days after your admission, you regained consciousness and our re-evaluation showed right sixth nerve palsy, right optic atrophy, and anosmia. We recommended a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan with contrast, but due to your old fracture and instrumentation, it wasn't possible.\nPatient: So what did you do instead?\nDoctor: We performed a CT scan with contrast, which revealed an intra-axial mass with perilesional edema and a cystic component. Our differential diagnosis was a high-grade glioma, an abscess, or metastatic deposits. We also did a metastatic workup, including a CT chest scan, pelvi-abdominal ultrasonography, and tumor markers like PSA and \u03b1-feto protein, which were all negative.\nPatient: What's the next step, doc?\nDoctor: We decided to proceed with a right frontal craniotomy with a trans-cortical approach. Intraoperatively, we palpated the brain surface but didn't find any underlying cystic lesion, and the needle aspiration didn't produce any fluid. We then proceeded with the transcortical approach and found a well-defined basal intraparenchymal mass.\nPatient: What did it look like?\nDoctor: The mass was reddish, soft in consistency, and we were able to excise it completely at the end of the procedure. We performed a postoperative CT scan to ensure its removal.\nPatient: Were there any complications?\nDoctor: We were not able to identify the optic nerves or the olfactory during the procedure, but we will continue to monitor your condition and provide appropriate care as needed.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doc. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to check on your progress and discuss any further treatment if necessary.",

Have you tried anything to alleviate the irritation?\nPatient: I've tried artificial tears and even irrigating it with tap water, but nothing helped. I eventually removed some things from my eye myself and went to the emergency department.\nDoctor: I have the examination results from the emergency department. They removed 11 larvae that were consistent with the first instar stage of O ovis (-). This was confirmed through a saline wet mount and light microscopy.\nPatient: Oh, that's gross.\nDoctor: Yes, it can be quite unsettling. Your left conjunctiva showed injection, but you had intact extra-ocular movements and normal visual acuity in both eyes. On slit lamp examination, they found multiple larvae in the bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral fornix of your left eye. Fortunately, they did not appear to be burrowing.\nPatient: So, what did they do about it?\nDoctor: They gave you polysporin-bacitracin-neomycin ophthalmic solution and albendazole 400 mg daily for 3 days as prophylaxis. A follow-up ophthalmology examination confirmed the clearance of larvae at 2 days.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: I also need to ask about your family history and travel history.\nPatient: My family has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. As for travel, I've only been around the southern San Joaquin Valley, California.\nDoctor: What about animal exposure? Do you have any pets or livestock at home?\nPatient: We have 4 dogs and 1 young chicken at home. I don't have any exposure to sheep, goats, bovines, or other livestock in my neighborhood.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information.

I was diagnosed with POAG ten years ago and have been suffering from eye discomfort in my right eye.\nDoctor: I see. You've been under treatment with hypotensive drugs and have been regularly controlling your IOP twice a year, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: So, during your control visit in January 2016, you reported irritating symptoms like burning, itchiness, and feeling sand in your right eye. Is that still the case?\nPatient: Yes, it's been really uncomfortable for the past six months.\nDoctor: I understand. You've tried several types of tear substitutes, but none of them seemed to provide any symptom relief. Your symptoms were scored as an OSDI of 74 out of 100 and a VAS score of pain of 85 mm out of 100 in your right eye. In your left eye, you had lighter symptoms with an OSDI score of 22 out of 100 and a VAS of 21 mm out of 100.

We prescribed a therapy with hyaluronic acid (HA) based tear substitute to be administered 4 times a day in both eyes. Have you been following that?\nPatient: Yes, I've been using the tear substitute as prescribed.\nDoctor: Good. In March 2016, we proposed an unconventional therapy with topical CBS for your right eye to reduce the pain symptoms since the previous therapeutic attempts were unsuccessful. You signed the informed consent and started the administration of CBS eye drops in April 2016, with a posology of 0.4 ml (8 drops) in your right eye, each day for a total of two months. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, I followed that treatment.\nDoctor: And during the first and second month, you received the CBS dosages as determined for the two lots. Now, in September 2016, how would you describe your current discomfort in your right eye?\nPatient: Well, I have noticed a significant relief from the subjective symptoms of discomfort in my right eye.\nDoctor: That's great to hear!

Your medical history also indicates that you've had significant ptosis and underwent some ophthalmological intervention. How has that been holding up?\nPatient: Hmm, not so great actually. The ptosis is still quite noticeable.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. At presentation, you mentioned that you're suffering from recurrent sinonasal disease. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Yes, I've been having this constant left-sided headache and a left fronto-orbital fistula discharge over my medial canthus. It's quite uncomfortable.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a computer tomography of your orbit, sinuses, and skull base to get a better understanding of your condition. The results showed a small A-P diameter of your frontal sinus and extensive neo-osteogenesis from chronic frontal sinusitis. \nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the inside of your frontal sinus is quite small and there's new bone formation due to the chronic inflammation. Unfortunately, an endonasal endoscopic approach to address this issue would likely be ineffective in your case.\nPatient: So, what can be done about this?\nDoctor: Our multidisciplinary team had a discussion about your situation and came up with an option to perform Riedel's procedure, along with concurrent excision of the fronto-orbital fistula, under the same anaesthetic. This should help alleviate your symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, and what exactly is Riedel's procedure?\nDoctor: Riedel's procedure is a surgical intervention that aims to remove the frontal sinus and recreate a healthy environment in your sinuses. By doing this, we hope to address the root cause of your chronic frontal sinusitis and left-sided headaches.\nPatient: I see. And the excision of the fronto-orbital fistula, what's that for?\nDoctor: The excision of the fronto-orbital fistula will help remove the abnormal connection between your frontal sinus and the orbit, which is causing the discharge over your medial canthus. This should improve your overall comfort and quality of life.\nPatient: Alright, sounds like a reasonable plan. How soon can we proceed with this?\nDoctor: We will schedule the procedure as soon as possible. Our team will provide you with all the necessary information and instructions for your preparation and post-operative care.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

Have you had any recent accidents or injuries?\nPatient: Yeah, I was in a road traffic accident and suffered a craniocerebral injury. I even had a tracheostomy.\nDoctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: I've had rheumatoid arthritis for 3 years now, and I'm taking methotrexate at 2.5 mg three times per day. I also take topiramate for my migraines, 200 mg twice a day.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let's do a clinical examination of your thyroid gland. *Examines patient* Your thyroid gland is not palpable and seems painless. I would recommend some laboratory tests to investigate further.\nPatient: Sure, doc. What do these tests involve?\nDoctor: We'll be checking for rheumatoid factor, antithyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies, among other things. *After tests* The results are in, and they confirm a positive rheumatoid factor with normal antithyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies at 16 U/ml and 16.7 U/ml, respectively.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It suggests that there might be an issue with your thyroid, so I would recommend an ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy to get a clearer picture.\nPatient: Okay, I had that done at a private clinic, and they found distinct nodules in the lower pole of my left thyroid lobe. The report said it's suggestive but not conclusive of malignancy.\nDoctor: In that case, we'll start you on thyroxine (T4) treatment to manage your hypothyroidism. Once you become euthyroid with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.89 \u03bcIU/ml, triiodothyronine (T3) level of 1.30 ng/mL, and T4 level of 7.2 \u03bcg/dl, we'll proceed with a total thyroidectomy at our hospital.\nPatient: Alright. What can you tell me about the thyroidectomy?\nDoctor: After the thyroidectomy, we'll examine the resected thyroid specimen. In your case, it was received in three pieces with multiple adhesions, and its total weight was 36 g. Two of the specimens showed small irregular follicles separated by reticular connective tissue, while the third specimen had five small areas of amorphous necrotic tissue.\nPatient: And what does the microscopic examination reveal?\nDoctor: The necrotizing lesions, 0.2 to 0.4 cm in diameter, corresponded to rheumatoid nodules. These are composed of a central area of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by palisading. This gives us more information about the condition of your thyroid and helps us determine the best course of action moving forward.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, doctor.

Your body temperature is 36.2\u00b0C, pulse rate is 71 beats/min with a regular rhythm, and blood pressure is 103/56 mm Hg. Our physical examination revealed decreased thoracic motion, muscle weakness of the right upper limb, numbness of the extremities, and claudication. No rales were audible, although breath sounds were decreased in both lungs.\nPatient: Hmm, what does all of that mean?\nDoctor: It means we need to investigate further to identify the cause. We've assessed your Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score (JOA score), which grades the status of patients suffering from cervical myelopathy. Your score is 14 points, indicating mild cervical myelopathy with no need for surgery at this time.\nPatient: Alright, so what's next?\nDoctor: We've conducted a Chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) to examine your lungs. Thankfully, there were no abnormal shadows in either lung field. However, the movement of your diaphragm was decreased when comparing the inspiratory X-ray with the expiratory image.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there could be some respiratory issues contributing to your symptoms. Additionally, we found that the ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of your cervical spine runs longitudinally across the vertebral body. Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thickened posterior longitudinal ligament that is severely compressing your cervical cord at C3/4. Your spinal cord MRI also showed atrophic change and an intramedullary lesion.\nPatient: So, what can be done for my condition?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we'll need to discuss the best course of action for managing your symptoms and preventing further complications.

What brought you to the emergency department today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing generalized abdominal pain for about a week now, along with nausea, unintentional weight loss of four pounds, and shortness of breath.\nDoctor: I see. We've done some initial blood work and it showed elevated liver enzymes and elevated total and direct bilirubin. We also performed a fecal occult blood test, which came back positive. To further investigate, we did a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. It demonstrated ascites, retroperitoneal and periportal lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly with extensive confluent masses in the liver parenchyma, indicating extensive metastatic disease.\nPatient: Oh wow, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: The scan also showed dilated loops of small bowel, a distended transverse colon, and a collapsed distal colon. We found that your tumor marker, CA 19-9, was elevated as well. We performed a core needle biopsy of your liver, and it exhibited poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining was positive for CDX2 and CK20, while being negative for PAX-8, CK7, p40, and TTF-1. This indicates that the lower gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of origin for this metastasis.\nPatient: So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We performed a colonoscopy, which showed a large 5 x 6 cm fungating and friable obstructing mass in your cecum, 90 cm from the anal verge. Biopsies were taken, and the results showed intramuscular adenocarcinoma in a background of tubulovillous adenocarcinoma. We performed a right hemicolectomy with ileostomy, and the resected specimen showed a 4.7 cm high-grade (poorly differentiated) adenocarcinoma involving the cecum and appendiceal orifice, perforating the parietal peritoneum.\nPatient: What does that mean for my staging?\nDoctor: The pathological staging of your tumor is pT4a, N1b, M1a according to the AJCC 7th edition. Immunohistochemistry showed a low probability of microsatellite instability (MSI).\nPatient: Is there anything else I should know?\nDoctor: Surprisingly, the surgical pathology report from the resected specimen also showed a distinct 1 cm well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in the distal half of your appendix, invading the visceral peritoneum. It stained positively for pancytokeratin and synaptophysin.\nPatient: Oh, that's unexpected. What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: We will discuss your case with a multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of action for your treatment.

Looking at your history, you were diagnosed with left maxillary sinus DLBL in July 2009, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When you were admitted in 2017, you were intubated and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for the management of status epilepticus. We also conducted a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain with contrast. It revealed a dominant left frontal mass approximately 3.8 cm in diameter with an adjacent rim of vasogenic edema.

You had left facial swelling, erythema, and pressure sensation for about seven weeks, right?\nPatient: Yes, my face was swollen and red, and it felt like there was a lot of pressure.\nDoctor: To diagnose your condition, we performed an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. It demonstrated a 2.3 x 1.4 cm focus anterior to the left maxilla. An oral surgery biopsy was done, and the definitive pathology diagnosis was DLBL with positive immunohistochemical stain for CD20, BCL2, LCA, and CD45RB. Your bone marrow biopsy was negative. You were staged as stage IIA with a CNS international prognostic index (CNS-IPI) score of four, which placed you in the high-risk group.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: You underwent three cycles of chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen and 36 Gy involved-field radiation therapy. The post-chemo/radiotherapy PET/CT scan showed decreased size and activity of the subcutaneous soft tissue mass anterior to the left maxilla with a residual mass of 2.4 x 0.6 cm. This mass resolved on further follow-up.\nPatient: Yes, I was relieved when that mass went away.\nDoctor: When the recent 2017 frontal lobe mass was discovered, we performed a biopsy with frameless CT-guided navigation. It confirmed DLBL with positive immunohistochemical stain for CD10, CD20, BCL2, and MUM1. Over 80% of the cells stained for Ki-.\nPatient: So what does that mean for me now?\nDoctor: It means that we need to continue monitoring your condition and follow up with appropriate treatment as needed.

Your comorbidities are limited to hypertension. Can you tell me more about your pain?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. The pain has been getting worse and more frequent, and it's really bothering me.\nDoctor: I understand. We performed a CT angiography and confirmed the presence of a 67-mm infrarenal AAA extending distally to the aortic bifurcation. The aneurysm sac doesn't contain any intraluminal thrombus. However, the neck of the aneurysm is extremely angulated, with the proximal landing zone measuring 16 mm in diameter. Your right common iliac artery is ectatic and measures 16 mm, while the left one appears normal. Both external iliac arteries are tortuous but within normal limits in diameter, measuring 7.8 and 7.6 mm on the right and left side, respectively.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also performed a stress echocardiogram, which showed good left ventricular function. Your pulmonary function is satisfactory with a forced vital capacity of 125% of predicted and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio of 84%.\nPatient: That's a relief, at least.\nDoctor: Given your age and general condition, our assessment is that open surgery would carry a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we believe that EVAR is the preferred treatment modality. It's a minimally invasive surgery, and it aligns with your preference over open repair.\nPatient: I see, so what's the plan?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the significantly narrowed aneurysm neck precludes the use of standard endografts, which have a minimum diameter of 23 mm. For you, this would entail 43% oversizing of the native aorta. To overcome the challenging anatomical morphology, we're considering a novel endovascular option of deploying a small diameter and short thoracic endograft into the proximal neck of the aneurysm, combined with telescopic deployment of a branched iliac device.\nPatient: And is this option approved?\nDoctor: Yes, we've gained consensus to proceed with this approach following discussion at our local multidisciplinary team meeting.\nPatient: What will happen during the procedure?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, you'll be positioned supine, and we'll adequately prep you for surgery. Surgical access will be obtained via bilateral groin cut-downs. After the procedure, we'll closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Sure, I've been experiencing some discomfort and pain in the right side of my abdomen recently.\nDoctor: I see. We have performed a CTAG on you, and based on the results, your tumor is classified as level II. Before the procedure, we also conducted a laboratory evaluation. Your results were as follows: Hb 83 g/L, CRP 52.2 mg/L, urea 5 mmol/L, creatinine 105.4 \u03bcmol/L, and WBC 12.2 \u00d7 109/L.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What does all that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate that there's an issue with your kidney function, and that's likely related to your tumor and the IVC thrombus. So, we decided to perform a right nephrectomy to address the issue.\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We dissected the right kidney and IVC in a standard manner. The IVC was dilated up to 5 cm just under the right ventricle. We removed your right kidney and the tumor dimensions were 120 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 70 mm. During the procedure, we also had to remove the tumorous thrombus in your IVC through cavotomy because it had infiltrated the IVC wall. We removed the thrombus in two pieces (65 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 mm and 42 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 32 mm).\nPatient: Wow, that sounds intense. Is everything okay now?\nDoctor: Yes, we resected the IVC wall where the tumor had infiltrated and closed the cavectomy with a primary suture. There was some residual stenosis after the closure, but it was around 40%. You were discharged on the 6th postoperative day with urea at 9.2 mmol/L and creatinine at 111.2 \u03bcmol/L.\nPatient: I'm glad that's over. What did the tests show about the tumor?\nDoctor: The tumor histology revealed that it was a clear cell renal carcinoma, classified as pT3a pNO, pMO, grade 3 according to the Fuhrman classification.\nPatient: What does that mean for me going forward?\nDoctor: You will need regular follow-ups to monitor your condition. Currently, you are alive and without recurrence of RCC or IVC tumor thrombus after 48 months of follow-up. We will continue to keep a close eye on your health to ensure there are no complications.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help and expertise.",

Your best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. We also performed an anterior segment examination, which was unremarkable. However, during the dilated fundus examination, we noticed red-orange lesions in the macula associated with RPE damage.\nPatient: Oh, I see.

In your case, we acquired the first OCT-A image using PLEX Elite 9000 nine months prior to the combination therapy, which also disclosed the BVN and polyp in the corresponding locations as indicated by IA.\nPatient: Were there any changes before the PDT?\nDoctor: Before incorporating PDT into your treatment, your eye received 9 additional IVRs. However, OCT-A after each injection showed no apparent changes in the BVN or polyp.\nPatient: So, what's next for my treatment?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we decided to switch to the combined therapy of IVR and PDT.

Was the pregnancy course uncomplicated?\nMother: Yes, it was pretty smooth, and no prenatal genetic testing was indicated at that time.\nDoctor: I see. Delivery was emergent due to fetal heart rate decelerations, and after delivery, a nuchal cord was noted. Her birth weight was 1304 g, which is between the 10-25th percentile for her gestational age. She stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for 2 months, during which her course was complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage of unknown grade. Were you aware of this?\nMother: Yes, we were informed about that.\nDoctor: Paternity testing was obtained a few months after birth due to court regulations involving you and the alleged father. 21 polymorphic loci were genotyped, and initial results appeared to exclude the alleged father from paternity due to genetic inconsistencies at loci F13A01 and D5S818. However, you insisted on the alleged father\u2019s paternity, and additional testing was performed. Is that correct?\nMother: Yes, I was sure he was the father, so we went for more testing.\nDoctor: During the resolution process, the lab tested PowerPlex\u00a9 ESX, PowerPlex\u00a9 Fusion, and PowerPlex\u00a9 LC5 test batteries. HLA testing was also performed. A notable finding was that your daughter was homozygous for maternal alleles for all loci located on chromosome 6. These findings prompted the laboratory to recommend that she receive a medical genetics evaluation for possible maternal uniparental disomy. Are you familiar with this condition?\nMother: Not really, can you explain it to me?\nDoctor: Maternal uniparental disomy is an underlying genetic condition where a child inherits both copies of chromosome 6 from the mother instead of one from each parent. This can lead to various health issues, depending on the specific genes involved.\nMother: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Your daughter presented for a medical genetics consultation at 10 months of age following the updated test results. During the visit, you reported that she appeared to be developing well and reaching milestones appropriately. Have you noticed any concerning symptoms since then?\nMother: No, she seems to be doing fine so far.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We will continue to monitor her development and health as she grows.

At that time, you were being treated with a combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and thiazide diuretic for a 20-year history of well controlled hypertension. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your best-corrected visual acuity was 10/10 in your right eye and 8/10 in the left eye. We also performed a slit-lamp examination, which showed that both anterior chambers had clear aqueous humor and no inflammatory reaction. Dilated fundus examination revealed a subretinal whitish mass and adjacent subretinal hemorrhage.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: The OCT confirmed the presence of a subretinal lesion and intraretinal edema.

I have been experiencing diffuse abdominal pain for the past day. It's been accompanied by nausea and I've had two episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any aggravating or relieving factors for the pain? Is it associated with food intake or recent antibiotic exposure?\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed anything making it worse or better, and it doesn't seem to be related to food or antibiotics. I also haven't had any fever, chills, rigors, or diarrhea.\nDoctor: Are you currently taking a proton pump inhibitor by any chance?\nPatient: No, I'm not taking any proton pump inhibitors.\nDoctor: I see. On examination, you are afebrile and tachycardic, meaning your heart rate is higher than normal. Your blood pressure is also a bit low at 85/61 mm Hg. Your abdominal examination showed diffuse mild tenderness without guarding or rigidity, and bowel sounds were present. We ran some lab tests, and your leucocyte count was elevated at 32 x 109 cells/L, with the normal range being 3.7-11 x 109 cells/L. Neutrophils made up 87% of these cells. Your serum lactate levels were also elevated at 4 mmol/L, with the normal range being 0.5-1.0 mmol/L. However, there was no sign of end-organ damage.\nPatient: That sounds concerning. Did you find out what's causing this?\nDoctor: We did some further tests, including urine and blood cultures, as well as a chest X-ray, but they did not reveal any source of infection. We then performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast. The scan showed mild-moderate prominence of the adjacent proximal and mid jejunum without bowel obstruction or evidence of colitis. This is most likely representing enteritis.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment for this?\nDoctor: Due to the concern for severe sepsis of unclear etiology, we initially started you on broad-spectrum antibiotics with IV pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. However, your signs and symptoms did not improve with these antibiotics. We then obtained stool studies, and C. difficile was confirmed on stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nPatient: Oh, I see. What do we do now?\nDoctor: We have started you on oral vancomycin 125 mg every six hours, and we have discontinued the IV antibiotics. Your signs and symptoms have improved after starting oral vancomycin.\nPatient: That's a relief. When can I go home?\nDoctor: You will be discharged home to complete a 14-day course of oral vancomycin.

Can you tell me what symptoms led you to seek medical attention?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I first presented with left inguinal swelling that lasted for about four months, starting in October 2018.\nDoctor: I see. And your ultrasound at that time showed a prominent left inguinal lymph node, for which a core biopsy was done in February 2019, confirming it to be melanoma. Your abdomen pelvis CT also revealed bilateral inguinal lymph nodes and a lesion at the splenic lower pole. A follow-up chest CT showed a neoplastic solid mass in the spleen. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: You then had a left inguinal node dissection in March 2019, which was positive for melanoma with 1/22 nodes positive, the largest one being 5 cm. A PET/CT scan in March 2019 showed multiple discrete hypermetabolic foci within the spleen, but no abnormal foci of increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in either the liver or lungs. You underwent splenectomy in April 2019, and the pathology report showed multiple foci of metastatic melanoma. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: After that, you started on pembrolizumab in April 2019. However, in January 2020, you presented to outpatient oncology with progressive generalized weakness, extreme fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, poor appetite, weight loss, and mood changes over a period of 6-8 weeks. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I just felt really weak and tired all the time, had muscle pain, no appetite, lost weight, and my mood was all over the place.\nDoctor: I understand. Labs in February 2020 showed low free cortisol of 0.2 ug/dL and low adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of < 1.1 pg/mL. Your luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin levels were normal. You were diagnosed with pembrolizumab-induced hypophysitis, and the decision was made to hold your pembrolizumab treatment. You were started on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with gradual tapering to the maintenance dose of 10 mg daily. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what my doctor told me.\nDoctor: Good. Now, I see that a repeat cortisol level done in March 2020 was within the normal range of 3.0 ug/dL, and your cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was also normal at 3.2 ug/dL. With these improvements, you were able to resume pembrolizumab treatment. How have you been feeling since resuming the treatment?\nPatient: I've been feeling better since then. My energy levels are improving, and my appetite is slowly coming back.\nDoctor: That's great to hear! Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and report any changes to your oncologist. It's important to keep your appointments and follow your treatment plan. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

I guess I kind of neglected it, though.\nDoctor: I see. How has your academic progression been, and have you ever been tested for diabetes?\nPatient: My academic progression was normal, and I had some medical work-ups at 14 and 17 years old. They ruled out diabetes because they didn't find any hyperglycemia.\nDoctor: Alright. Can you tell me if you experienced any changes around the age of 20 years?\nPatient: Yes, I became polyphagic and my weight increased from 60 to 90 kg, but I didn't have any other complaints.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. It seems that a brain MRI was performed about 5 months after that, and it revealed a large hypothalamus mass, 20x20mm in size, with thickening of the pituitary stalk and compression of the third ventricle. There was also a strong contrast enhancement after the administration of gadolinium.\nPatient: Oh, yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: You were then admitted to the department of endocrinology, and the biological explorations concluded that you had a panhypopituitarism associated with diabetes insipidus. During the initial assessment, we discovered that you presented stage I obesity with a BMI of 26.6 kg/m2, a delayed bone age relative to your chronological age, and a growth delay with a deceleration of linear growth at the age of 15 years.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: A stereotactic biopsy of the brain mass was performed when you were 21 years old, and the immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CD1a and PS100, which supports the diagnosis of LCH.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We explored the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation because it is associated with more severe disease and irreversible damage, such as neurologic and pituitary injuries. If present, it could have offered the possibility of a targeted therapy by BRAF inhibitors, like vemurafenib or PLX8394, a second-generation BRAF inhibitor.\nPatient: So, did they find the mutation?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the BRAF V600E mutation was not observed, which limits the possibility of using BRAF inhibitors for treatment.\nPatient: I see.

Your current dosages are MTX 12 mg/week, prednisolone 2.5 mg/day, and bucillamine 100 mg/day. It looks like your symptoms were not well controlled initially, so the MTX dose was gradually increased. Other medical history includes benign prostatic hyperplasia and gout. You've also smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 20 years, but you don't drink alcohol. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: On presentation, you were alert, and your Glasgow Coma Score was 15. Your body mass index is 23.7 kg/m2, and there have been no noticeable body weight changes. Let's go over your vital signs: blood pressure is 128/57 mmHg, pulse is 88/minute, body temperature is 39.2 \u00b0C, respiratory rate is 18/minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%. \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: During your physical examination, we noted chronic swelling of your wrists and ulnar deviation of your digits, but no other abnormal findings. You've been adequately treated for your RA, but we didn't observe any enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. \nPatient: Hmm, alright.\nDoctor: Our laboratory studies revealed findings of elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R). Your serum hepatobiliary enzymes, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody levels were also elevated. Three months prior to your admission, these serum hepatobiliary enzymes were within the normal range, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Importantly, no lymphoma cells were detected in your blood work. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes to us.\nPatient: Alright, thank you. I'll make sure to do that.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you manage your RA and overall health.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I used to work in a scientific lab at a large academic institution.\nDoctor: I see. It looks like seven years prior to your presentation, you started experiencing a right-handed tremor that increased in severity over several months, and you were eventually evaluated by a neurologist who diagnosed you with PD. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: You were treated with various dopaminergic medications, including carbidopa-levodopa, but you had poor symptom relief. So you decided to go for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment. How did that go?\nPatient: Well, I got the DBS in the left VIM three years ago, and it really helped with my right-handed tremor.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. However, it seems that you started to develop a worsening left-handed tremor and bradykinesia, which required restarting treatment with carbidopa-levodopa. Did the increased dosage of carbidopa-levodopa help control your Parkinsonian symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, it did help, but they had to keep increasing the dosage over time.\nDoctor: I understand. In addition to adjusting your medication, the settings of your DBS were also increased for continued control of the right-handed tremor. Is that right?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: During this time, it appears that you began experiencing changes in behavior, such as apathy and poor communication skills in social settings. Your family also noticed uncharacteristic hypersexuality, anger, and impulsivity. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, I'm afraid so.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, a month prior to your presentation, you attempted suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Emergency services were able to transport you to the Emergency Department in time. Do you remember what your oxygen saturation level and carboxyhemoglobin level were at that time?\nPatient: I'm not sure about the exact numbers, but I think my oxygen saturation was around 94%, and my carboxyhemoglobin level was really high.\nDoctor: That's correct. Your oxygen saturation was 94%, and your arterial blood gas study showed a carboxyhemoglobin level of 49.3 (normal is less than 2). Due to these findings, neurology and psychiatry were consulted to evaluate your neurological and mental status. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better, but it's still a struggle sometimes.\nDoctor: I understand. Our team will continue to work closely with you and your family to provide the best possible care. We'll make sure to monitor your medication and DBS settings closely, and we'll also address any mental health concerns. It's important that you communicate any changes in your symptoms or behavior to us, so we can make appropriate adjustments.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me what you've noticed?\nPatient: Yes, back in October 2013, I saw a blind spot in the central vision of my left eye.\nDoctor: I see. We performed an SD-OCT and diagnosed it as a small macular hole (MH) with an adhesion expanse of 218 \u03bcm (Fig. a). At that time, your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.1. To treat it, we injected 0.2 ml of C3F8 gas into the vitreous of your eye. How did your vision change after that?\nPatient: It seemed to improve a little bit, I think.\nDoctor: Yes, your BCVA increased to 0.2 after the gas injection. After another week, we checked your eye with OCT and there were no more signs of tractional forces. However, the hole remained open and actually increased in size to 475 \u03bcm (Fig. b). Since the macular hole failed to close after 1.5 months, we decided to perform a vitrectomy with gas. How has your vision been since the vitrectomy?\nPatient: It feels better than before the surgery, but still not perfect.\nDoctor: That's understandable. The vitrectomy was successful in increasing your BCVA to 0.2, but it may not completely restore your vision to what it was before the macular hole developed. It's important to continue monitoring your eye health and report any changes in your vision to us. We'll also schedule regular follow-up appointments to ensure everything is healing properly.\nPatient: Okay, thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing to help my eye heal?\nDoctor: Just be sure to follow any post-operative instructions we've provided, and avoid any activities that could put strain on your eye. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.\nPatient: Alright, I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

We need to run some tests to get a better understanding of your condition. Let's start with a liver function test.\n(After receiving the test results)\nDoctor: Your liver function test results are consistent with obstructive jaundice. Your total bilirubin is 154 \u03bcmol/l, direct bilirubin is 152 \u03bcmol/l, SGOT is 147 U/l, SGPT is 67 U/l, and ALP is 731 U/l. We need to perform a transabdominal ultrasonography to further assess the situation.\n(After the ultrasonography)\nDoctor: The ultrasonography revealed hepatomegaly, moderately dilated intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBD) and common bile duct (CBD), as well as a distended gall bladder. We need to conduct a contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen with a pancreas-specific protocol for more details.\n(After the CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an enhancing soft tissue density in your distal common bile duct, with upstream dilatation of the CBD, common hepatic duct (CHD), and IHBD. Based on these findings, we've diagnosed you with distal cholangiocarcinoma. The treatment for this condition is a surgical procedure called Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nPatient: Okay, so when will I undergo the surgery?\nDoctor: We will schedule the surgery as soon as possible.\n(After the surgery)\nDoctor: After dividing the common hepatic duct during the surgery, we noticed two openings, which initially led us to believe that the division occurred at the confluence. However, on further evaluation, we found that the confluence was intact, and it was actually a septum in the CHD that was giving the false impression. We also noticed a septum extending from the hilum with the cystic duct opening on the right side, suggesting duplication of the common bile duct. However, the septum was not extending up to the papilla.\nPatient: I see. So, was this anatomical variation detected in the imaging before the surgery?\nDoctor: This anatomical variation was not appreciated in the imaging preoperatively. Upon retrospective evaluation of the cross-sectional imaging, we found an incomplete septum extending from the hilum to the distal end of the common bile duct. This is a rare finding and was not detected earlier.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. What are the follow-up requirements after the surgery?\nDoctor: You will need regular follow-ups to monitor your recovery and to check for any complications.

We decided to continue the pregnancy. What should we do next?\nDoctor: It's important to keep monitoring your baby during the pregnancy. We can perform a detailed fetal ultrasound scan at 32 weeks of gestation to check for any ocular abnormalities.\nMother: We had the scan, and thankfully, no abnormalities were observed. Our baby girl was born full-term with a weight of 3,300 g. What should we do now?\nDoctor: Congratulations on your baby girl! We performed a postnatal FFA, which did not reveal any leakage.

Due to persistent leukocytosis, we performed a repeat abdominal CT scan, which showed a 2.1 cm fish bone as a radiopaque foreign body at the level of the falciform fissure with inflammation tracking to the abscess cavity.\nPatient: How did that get there?\nDoctor: It's unclear at the moment. We performed an upper endoscopy, but it failed to visualize a fistulous opening by the foreign body in the gastric antrum. We discussed your case in a multidisciplinary hepatobiliary conference.\nPatient: What's the plan, then?\nDoctor: Since you've shown rapid clinical improvement with minimal biliary drain output, we removed the drains and treated you with extended intravenous antibiotics. We saw you in the clinic six weeks later, and you had no complaints.\nPatient: Yeah, I've been feeling a lot better.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. We performed repeat CT imaging, which indicated a resolution of the hepatic abscess to a size of 1.7x1.3 cm without any further migration of the foreign body.\nPatient: So, am I all good now?\nDoctor: Yes, it seems that the treatment has been successful, and there is no further migration of the foreign body. Just make sure to continue monitoring your health and reach out if you experience any new symptoms or concerns.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome!

Can you tell me about your medical history?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm 70 years old, and I have a history of dyslipidaemia. I also have a habit of smoking.\nDoctor: I see. Unfortunately, you recently suffered an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Did you receive any interventions for this?\nPatient: Yes, they couldn't do a percutaneous coronary artery intervention right away, so they performed thrombolysis within 4 hours of my symptoms starting.\nDoctor: Okay. It seems that you developed an advanced atrioventricular block after that, requiring a transcutaneous pacemaker. You also experienced cardiorespiratory arrest in ventricular fibrillation, but it was reversed after one cycle of advanced life support. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I understand you were then transported by airplane to a PCI-capable center. They performed a coronary angiography, which showed a 50-60% stenosis in the proximal segment of your right coronary artery. They treated it with a metal stent. Can you confirm that?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they did.\nDoctor: An echocardiography was also performed, revealing moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 35%, inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal akinesia, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Do you remember this test?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: After your 10-hour flight, you were admitted to our intensive care unit in cardiogenic shock, requiring inotropes and non-invasive ventilation. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation of uncertain mechanism, along with moderate left and right ventricle systolic dysfunction. Is this correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: We performed a transoesophageal echocardiography, which revealed a 9 mm disruption of the posteromedial papillary muscle, consistent with a contained rupture. This instability in the sub-valvular apparatus caused a broad posterior leaflet prolapse, leading to severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentric jet with Coanda effect, reaching the left atria roof. Are you following me so far?\nPatient: Yes, I understand.\nDoctor: Due to these findings, you underwent an urgent mitral valve replacement with a biological prosthetic valve, preserving both anterior and posterior leaflets. Your post-operative recovery went well, and you were discharged 12 days after surgery. You'll need to continue anticoagulant therapy for three months. Does that sound right to you?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Great. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team to monitor your progress and ensure the effectiveness of your treatment. Do you have any questions or concerns?\nPatient: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

How has your creatinine level been during this time?\nPatient: It was within normal range when it was last checked.\nDoctor: Alright. I noticed that we performed a renal biopsy on you. The results showed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibro-cellular crescents in one out of 18 glomeruli, excluding one global sclerotic glomerulus. The immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the deposition of IgA and C3 in mesangial areas. There was also weak but significant IgG deposition in the glomeruli, somewhat different from the distribution of IgA or C3. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of electron-dense deposits in mesangial areas. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: To manage your condition, you were started on antihypertensive therapy, mainly with an RAS inhibitor. However, eight months later, your serum creatinine suddenly rose to 4.53 mg/dL from 1.04 mg/dL a month before. Urinalysis showed 100 red blood cells per high power field and urinary protein excretion of 12.3 g/gCr. We then conducted serological tests to differentiate the cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The tests revealed the presence of anti-GBM antibody at a titer of 116 IU/mL and the absence of anti-nuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: After your admission, we initiated treatments with hemodialysis, plasma exchange, and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 50 mg/day. We performed a second renal biopsy at four weeks after admission to assess the probability of renal recovery and make a final diagnosis. The biopsy revealed cellular to fibrocellular crescents in 18 of 25 glomeruli, excluding six global sclerotic glomeruli. The immunofluorescence study showed linear IgG deposition along the glomerular capillary walls and mesangial staining for IgA.\nPatient: What does that mean for my condition?\nDoctor: The results of the second biopsy, along with your clinical history and lab findings, confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatments as needed to ensure the best possible outcome.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

You had a THA placed thirty-one years ago, right?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: And you also had a papillary bladder tumor that was treated with fulguration five years prior to admission, followed by a recurrence of bladder carcinoma in situ diagnosed a year later, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I underwent six initial and six maintenance instillations of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin treatment, which is a strain of Mycobacterium bovis, and my bladder cancer went into remission.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. Now, tell me more about this new pain in your left thigh.\nPatient: Well, about four years after the BCG therapy, I developed new-onset drainage from my left lateral thigh. It started swelling and I've been having increasing purulent discharge, pain with movement, chills, rigors, and a fever of 101 \u00b0F.\nDoctor: How are you feeling today? Are you still experiencing fever?\nPatient: I'm afebrile now and my vital signs are normal.\nDoctor: Good to know. Let me examine your thigh. Hmm, there's an open wound on the lateral left thigh with purulent drainage and surrounding erythema. Does it hurt when I adduct your left hip?\nPatient: Yes, it's painful.\nDoctor: I'd like to order some laboratory tests. Your white blood cell count is 10,200 cells/mm3, C-reactive protein is 9.7 mg/dL, and sedimentation rate is 71 mm/hr. We also took a radiograph of your left hip, which showed extensive lucencies around the left THA.\nPatient: What does that mean, Doctor?\nDoctor: It means we need to take further action. You underwent incision and drainage with an antibiotic spacer placed following admission. Wound, hip fluid, and abscess cultures obtained during irrigation and debridement were negative for bacterial pathogens. However, given your history of prior BCG therapy, we asked the microbiology laboratory to perform mycobacterial cultures, which grew acid-fast bacilli concerning for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.\nPatient: Oh, no. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We initially treated you with clindamycin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Now, you'll be started on isoniazid 300 mg PO daily and rifampin for your tuberculosis complex.

Can you tell me more about the intestinal bleeding you experienced after the fasting periods?\nPatient: Sure, Doc. I had bleeding after the Islamic fasting month, Ramadan. It was pretty intense.\nDoctor: I see. Your ulcerative colitis was confirmed by clinical manifestations and a colon biopsy. You were on azathioprine 50 mg/day and high-dose prednisolone 60 mg/day for 2 months prior to your hospital admission. How did you feel during that treatment?\nPatient: Well, the prednisolone caused my blood sugar to go up, so I had to start taking insulin for my diabetes about a month before being admitted to the hospital.\nDoctor: That's correct. You were also on anticoagulant drugs for the treatment of your deep vein thrombosis. After you were admitted to the hospital, you developed progressive periorbital ecchymosis, extensive edema of the nasal area, and a nasal ulcer. Your eye examination revealed proptosis with a 4+ light reaction, evidence of an afferent pupillary defect, also known as Marcus Gunn pupil, no light perception, absolute blindness, ophthalmoplegia, and neurological defects of cranial nerves 2, 3, 4, and 6. \nPatient: Yeah, my eyes were in really bad shape.

I remember feeling really sick during that time.\nDoctor: Given your medical history and the results of your examination, it's important to continue managing your ulcerative colitis and diabetes. You should continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your blood sugar levels closely. It's also crucial to follow up with your healthcare team for regular check-ups to ensure your conditions are well-managed.\nPatient: Okay, Doc.

Can you tell me more about when the limb pain is aggravated and what helps to alleviate it?\nPatient: The pain usually gets worse at night, but it's moderately relieved during physical activities and cold baths.\nDoctor: Have you been taking any medication for the pain?\nPatient: Yes, I'm on daily analgesic medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, and weak opioid agonists.\nDoctor: I understand you're on sick leave from your university studies due to these symptoms. Are you also experiencing a leg length discrepancy?\nPatient: Yes, I have been using shoe inserts because of the difference in leg length.\nDoctor: I also read that you consulted a rheumatologist at age 11 due to hip joint pain. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: They did a hip joint puncture guided by ultrasound because of fluid gathering. But the serology was negative, and the joint pain stopped after the puncture.\nDoctor: Were there any incidents prior to your referral to our clinic that may have impacted your condition?\nPatient: About six months ago, I was hit by a car at knee level in a traffic accident. I was discharged from the ER without a suspected fracture, and they didn't do a radiological examination. My femoral pain worsened after the accident.\nDoctor: During the clinical examination, we didn't find any skin lesions, caf\u00e9 au lait spots, or redness. We also didn't notice any increased temperature or swelling in your right thigh. Your leg length was unequal but within normality. \nPatient: That's good to know.\nDoctor: We would like you to keep a daily diary to track your pain on an analog scale from zero to 10, with increasing values representing more intense pain. If your pain exceeds a score of 6, you should take orally administered analgesics. Please reserve a score of 10 for pain that prevents you from falling asleep and doesn't respond well to the medication.\nPatient: Okay, I can do that.\nDoctor: We've also performed magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans.

Did you have any chest pain, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms.\nDoctor: Alright. Can you describe your baseline activities?\nPatient: Sure, I'd say they're consistent with New York Heart Association Class 2.\nDoctor: Are you currently on any medications?\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking Atorvastatin, Cyclosporine, Finasteride, Levothyroxine, Mirtazapine, Mycophenolate, Omeprazole, Prednisone, Quetiapine, Ranitidine, Tamsulosin, and Zolpidem.\nDoctor: Did you recently take any Prednisone?\nPatient: Yeah, I completed a 4-day course of Prednisone for a gout flare-up.\nDoctor: Do you have any known allergies?\nPatient: Yes, I'm allergic to Azithromycin.\nDoctor: Do you smoke, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol?\nPatient: No, I don't use any of those substances.\nDoctor: Upon arrival, your vitals were as follows: afebrile, heart rate 54 bpm, blood pressure 184/89 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. Your physical examination was unremarkable. Your cardiac biomarkers showed a CK of 59 U/L and a troponin of 0.11NG/ML, which is slightly elevated. Your B type natriuretic peptide was also elevated at 371 PG/ML. \nPatient: Hmm, what do those numbers mean?\nDoctor: It means there might be some issues with your heart. Your lab results showed normal sodium, magnesium, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin levels, but your potassium was a bit low at 3.3 mmol/L. We also performed an electrocardiogram, which revealed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads, but this was unchanged compared to your prior ECG.\nPatient: What about the cardiac monitoring and echocardiogram?\nDoctor: Your cardiac monitoring showed no evidence of arrhythmias. The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55\u201365%, a left posterior wall of 1.3 cm and an interventricular septal wall of 1.2 cm, with a thickened trabeculated apex.\nPatient: So, what does all of this mean for me, doc?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we need to keep an eye on your heart health and potassium levels. I will adjust your medications accordingly and recommend regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition.

This will be performed on the tenth day of your hospital admission.\nPatient: What did you find after the surgery?\nDoctor: The resected esophagectomy specimen contained a fungating tumor measuring 45 and 40 mm in the longitudinal and cross-sectional dimensions. Histopathology showed that most tumor tissue was composed of epidermoid cells arranged in nests. We also identified keratin pearl formation.\nPatient: What else did you find?\nDoctor: Columnar mucus-secreting cells and intermediate cells in small areas were forming tube-like structures with invasive growth. We confirmed this through hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was found to be positive for p-63 and CK5/6, which identified it as epidermoid.\nPatient: I see.

How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I've been doing okay, but I still have some concerns.\nDoctor: I see. Let's review your case. At the time of your admission, our physical examination found an enlarged nodular lesion over your right shoulder and several smaller nodular lesions on your abdomen. Have you noticed any changes in these lesions?\nPatient: Yes, the lesions seem to have improved a lot since then.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Your complete blood count showed leukocytosis at 19.4 \u00d7 109 cells/L with 78% segmented neutrophils, 2% band form, 11% lymphocytes, and 9% monocytes. Your C-reactive protein level was 132.26 mg/L, and serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 392 U/L. High-resolution computed tomography revealed multiple lung opacities and mediastinal, cervical, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies.\nPatient: Oh, I remember that. It was quite concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it was. We performed a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, which showed no lymphoma cells. However, we did find lymphoma cells in your lymph node biopsies, which confirmed your ALK+ ALCL diagnosis. The lymphoma cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD30, ALK1, Bcl-6, MUM1, and TIA-1, but negative for CD20, CD5, cyclin D1, CD10, TdT, CD8, and PD1.\nPatient: That's a lot of medical terms, but I'm glad you found the cause of my symptoms.\nDoctor: Indeed. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype. Your lymph nodes also displayed a relatively small number of small-to-large hallmark cells with reniform nuclei. Due to the rate small cell ALCL variant morphology resembling classic ALCL, it was initially misdiagnosed as ALK+ ALCL.\nPatient: I see. But I remember you mentioned that I achieved complete remission 4 months after the diagnosis?\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. Your treatment involved an initial course of intravenous dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, along with intrathecal administration of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone. Then, you received 3 alternating cycles of A and B regimens every 3 weeks. Regimen A included dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, etoposide, and ifosfamide, while regimen B consisted of dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate.\nPatient: Yeah, the treatments were quite intense.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, new skin lesions were later noted in your lower back, and ALCL relapse was confirmed by skin biopsy 28 months after the initial treatment. Based on these findings, we may need to discuss further treatment options. How have you been feeling lately? Have you noticed any new symptoms?\nPatient: I have been feeling a bit tired, but I haven't noticed any other new symptoms.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. We'll keep monitoring your condition and discuss potential treatment options to address the relapse. Please keep me updated on any changes in your symptoms or overall health.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help with this.",

I had a few severe sneezes while walking outside and then noticed the swelling.\nDoctor: I see. Let me examine the area. Alright, I can see a large swelling of the left hemiscrotum. I recall that you were diagnosed with a left-sided varicocele 6 months ago here in our hospital (Fig.). Do you have any other medical history?\nPatient: No, that's the only thing I've had.\nDoctor: We've taken some blood samples and the results are negative. We'll also perform a Colour Doppler-Ultrasonography (CDU) to get a better understanding of the swelling.\nPatient: Okay, thanks.\nDoctor: The CDU results show the known varicocele, a normal vascularized left testis, and a swelling of low echogenicity of 39x29mm without blood flow, which indicates a scrotal bleeding (Fig.). The hematoma is considered self-limiting, and we expect spontaneous resorption.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what's next?\nDoctor: We'll schedule a follow-up ultrasonography in 2 months to monitor the hematoma. \nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: After 2 months, the ultrasonography showed that the swelling had increased in size to 40x40mm (Fig.). We referred you to an academic hospital for further evaluation.\nPatient: Yeah, I remember that.\nDoctor: They performed a CT-scan of your abdomen which showed a prominent vena spermatica on the left, without suspicion of an arteriovenous malformation. A 3D replica of the CT-scan was made to better illustrate the size of the hematoma (Fig.).\nPatient: That's when they decided to do the surgery, right?\nDoctor: Yes, three months post-event, as the hematoma further increased in size to 50x37x30mm, you underwent a microscopic inguinal varicocelectomy.\nPatient: How has it been healing since the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgery, the hematoma showed signs of reabsorption, decreasing in size to 38x24x21mm 4 months post-event; 20x16x11mm 6 months post-event; and eventually, no residual hematoma 15 months post-event.

Well, let's proceed with a physical examination. \n[After examination]\nDoctor: Your examination shows that your cervix is 60% to 70% effaced and 3 cm dilated. The baby is in cephalic presentation, and your amniotic membranes are intact. We also performed a fetal ultrasound, which showed an isolated anechoic hepatic cyst measuring 1.32/1.47 cm.\nPatient: Oh! Where exactly is the cyst located?\nDoctor: The cyst is situated in the right anterior abdominal compartment between the gallbladder and the umbilical vein. At this time, we're not certain if it's located in the parenchyma or choledocal, but due to its position, we suspect it's a parenchymal cyst (Fig. ).\nPatient: Hmm, I see. What about the results from the Color Doppler imaging?\nDoctor: The Color Doppler flow imaging did not show any flow in the cystic mass, and it confirmed that the cyst is situated to the right of the umbilical vein (Fig. ).\n[After the delivery]\nDoctor: Congratulations! You've delivered a healthy female fetus in cephalic presentation. Your baby weighed 2440 g at birth, and she's been diagnosed with low weight for gestational age. Don't worry, we'll keep a close eye on her.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. How were the Apgar scores?\nDoctor: The Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. Additionally, the acid/base, co-oximetry, oxygen status, and electrolytes values from the umbilical arterial blood were unremarkable and documented immediately after birth.\nPatient: That's a relief. What about the hepatic function panel results?\nDoctor: At 36 hours after birth, the hepatic function panel showed a slightly elevated aspartate aminotransferase level of 43 U/L, which is just above the normal limit of 37 U/L. The total bilirubin level was 5.2 mg/dL, corresponding to the low-risk zone at 36 hours after birth, according to the Bhutani nomogram.\nPatient: So, what's the next step for my baby?\nDoctor: We're referring your newborn to the pediatric surgery unit for further multidisciplinary evaluation. A recent abdominal sonography confirmed the presence of a 1.6/0.93 cm intrahepatic cyst situated to the left of the gallbladder.

No one in my family has psoriasis.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Upon examination, I see yellowish firm verrucous plaques on the skin of your gluteal cleft. I believe these plaques are a lichenoid granulomatous reaction to the silicone. Have you received any treatments for this?\nPatient: Yes, I had four monthly sessions of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injections, and I also used a high-potency topical corticosteroid called clobetasol ointment once a day for four months. But there was no improvement.\nDoctor: I see. I also noticed that the initial plaques have become red and a new 6-mm, erythematous plaque with a silvery scale has developed on your right buttock. The morphology of this new plaque is different than your presenting skin lesions. We need to consider the possibility of squamous cell carcinoma, psoriasis, or lichen planus.

The microscopic examination of the epidermis demonstrated confluent parakeratosis with neutrophilic microabscesses, regular acanthosis, elongated rete ridges, and a thin or absent granular layer. The upper dermis showed chronic inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, edema, and vascular ectasia with tortuous capillaries.

We've reviewed your records and it seems you're a healthy 60-year-old male with no comorbidities and you've never smoked, which is good. Due to your severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation was already performed prior to your admission here.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. They did that to help me breathe better.\nDoctor: After your admission, we took a chest X-ray and found an apical left-sided pneumothorax of approximately 2 cm, accompanied by a large subcutaneous emphysema. To treat this, we inserted two chest tubes, one on each side. After that, your left lung was fully expanded again, the subcutaneous emphysema resolved, and no air leak could be observed.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds good. I'm glad the tubes helped.\nDoctor: Unfortunately, on day 14, you developed a massive and progressive subcutaneous emphysema again, accompanied by a large air leak of about 5000 ml per minute on the left side. We had to insert a second and a third chest tube on the left, one in Monaldi's position (3rd intercostal space mid-clavicular) and the other in B\u00fclau's position (5th intercostal space slightly anterior to the mid-axillary line).\nPatient: That's quite a lot. I didn't realize it was so serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it's quite concerning. On day 16, a chest X-ray and chest CT-scan showed a complete left-sided pneumothorax. A central venous catheter was placed on the left internal jugular vein, six days before the onset of the air leak. We believe that the air leak, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema are a result of barotrauma due to invasive mechanical ventilation.\nPatient: I see. What are the next steps, then?\nDoctor: Due to progressive hypercapnia and severe respiratory acidosis, we performed a tracheostomy and established a vvECMO (PLS Set and ROTAFLOW Console) on day 16, using an Avalon Elite\u2122 Bi-Caval Dual Lumen Catheter. Blood gas analysis before the start of the extracorporeal lung assistance showed a PaCO2 of 88 mmHg with a pH of 7.30, and PaO2 of 90 mmHg.\nPatient: I'm not familiar with all those terms, but I trust you're doing what's best for me.\nDoctor: We're doing everything we can to help you recover. The tracheostomy and vvECMO will provide the necessary support for your lungs while they heal. We'll closely monitor your condition and adjust the treatment as needed.

Twelve months after the EUS-HGS, we replaced the PS with an MS. Since then, your hepatobiliary enzymes have normalized, and cholangitis has not recurred in 11 months.

Your renal parameters indicate pre-renal failure, so we'll start you on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to your high leukocyte counts.\nPatient: I see. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We'll perform an emergency laparotomy to address the perforation and peritonitis. Intraoperatively, we found approximately 500 mL of fecal-contaminated peritoneal fluid which we cleared. There was a 1 x 1 cm2 rent in your rectosigmoid junction, and bowel wall thickening was present at that location. Distal to the perforation, your rectum was found to be collapsed. Fortunately, no pelvic deposits or growths were found.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: We performed a primary closure of the rent in two layers and thoroughly washed the peritoneal cavity. Afterward, a diverting transverse colostomy was done for manual bowel decompression. You'll need intensive postoperative care for a week to recover.\nPatient: I understand.\nDoctor: We'll start you on oral fluids on the tenth postoperative day. You'll be discharged after three weeks of hospital stay. During this time, we'll closely monitor your progress, and a colostomy closure will be scheduled six weeks after the primary surgery.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor, for taking care of me and explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",

Do you have any past history of trauma, surgery, or infection in the area where you're experiencing the swelling?\nPatient: No, I don't have any history of that.\nDoctor: Alright, let me examine the area. Hmm, I can feel a non-tender, cystic swelling of about 5x5 cm in your right parotid region, causing your earlobe to lift. Does the swelling become more prominent when you clench your teeth?\nPatient: Yes, it does.\nDoctor: I also notice that the swelling is not fixed to the skin or any underlying structures. Let me check your oropharyngeal and facial nerves... There seem to be no abnormalities. There is also no cervical lymphadenopathy. Let's run some routine blood tests and perform an ultrasonography (USG) of the parotid gland to get a better understanding of what's going on.\nPatient: Okay, sounds good.\n(After the tests)\nDoctor: Your blood tests came back within normal limits. The ultrasonography revealed a cystic lesion measuring 5x6 cm involving the superficial lobe of your right parotid gland. We also performed a fine needle aspiration cytology on the lesion, but the results were inconclusive. I'd like to schedule you for surgery to address the issue.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\n(After the surgery)\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We discovered that you had a multiloculated cyst arising from the superficial lobe of your right parotid. We were able to excise the cyst in its entirety. You should recover well from the procedure.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What did the histopathological examination show?\nDoctor: The examination found that the cyst wall had a flattened outlining, with fibrocollagenous and proteinaceous material along with scattered lymphocytes and macrophages. The findings are suggestive of lymphangioma of the parotid gland.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We'll keep you under medical surveillance for six months to monitor any local recurrence.

The tumor is composed of a solid part with hemorrhaging, and it seems that it has caused you to have massive ascites.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds really serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is quite concerning. Additionally, your preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is elevated to 237.3 U/ml, which is much higher than the normal range of less than 35.0 U/ml. However, your carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) values are within their respective normal ranges.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means that we need to perform a series of surgeries to remove the tumor and affected areas. We will be doing a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, omentectomy, lymphadenectomy, peritonectomy of vesicouterine excavation, resection of disseminated lesion of Douglas' pouch, and a biopsy of the colonic mesentery without leaving any residual disease behind.\nPatient: That's a lot to take in. What happened during the surgery?\nDoctor: During the surgery, we found massive hemorrhagic ascites of 4000 ml present in your peritoneal cavity.

However, ten days later, the treatment was discontinued due to G3 skin toxicity, specifically Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome. Is that right?\nPatient: Yes, I had a really bad reaction to the medication.\nDoctor: I see that in January 2013, you then started metronomic capecitabine (500 mg twice daily, continuous administration), which was well-tolerated.

Can you tell me more about it?\nPatient: Yes, the pain has been getting worse over time and it's really affecting my daily life.\nDoctor: I see. We conducted some tests to find out the cause of the pain. The X-ray images showed an osteolytic tumor in the metadiaphysis of your right distal femur with cortical bone destruction on the dorsolateral side. There was no matrix calcification.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: We also performed an MRI, which revealed that the tumor has destroyed the cortex and extended to the surrounding soft tissues. There was strong tumor enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor is growing and affecting the nearby tissues. We performed a resection of your right distal femur to remove the tumor. The tumor measured 12 x 4 cm and on the cut surface, it appeared pale and fibrous, with an extension to surrounding soft tissue.\nPatient: What did the histology report say?\nDoctor: The tumor histology strongly resembled the desmoplastic fibroma diagnosed in a previous case, but with some differences. It was made up of bundles of moderate cellular tissue, with fibroblast-like, spindle cells in abundant collagenous stroma. However, there was evidence of invasive growth in trabecular bone and surrounding skeletal muscle tissue.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We conducted a cytogenetic analysis which showed an abnormal karyotype: 47~49,XX,del(13) (q12q32),+ 1~2r,+1~2mar,1dmin [cp17]/46,XX [2]. This indicates an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (q12q32), consistent with heterozygous loss of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene.\nPatient: Is that bad?\nDoctor: It's a concern, as the loss of this gene can increase the risk of cancer. With cancer hotspot NGS analysis, we found amplification of CDK4 (NM_000075.3) and an imbalance of the RB1 gene on chromosome 13.\nPatient: What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: The IHC results showed that tumor cells exhibited strong nuclear staining for CDK4 and moderate nuclear staining for SATB2. RB1 expression was heterogeneous, not completely lost. This information will help us determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you, which may include further surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll do whatever it takes to get better.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We will work closely with you to ensure the best possible outcome.

Can you tell me what symptoms you were experiencing at that time?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I was having blurry vision and some distortion in my right eye.\nDoctor: I see. According to your medical records (Fig. a), at your first presentation, your BCVA, or best-corrected visual acuity, was 0.5. Additionally, your right eye showed a macula pucker. The foveal thickness was 603 \u03bcm, and the adhesion diameter was 69 \u03bcm. After 47 days without any spontaneous resolution, your surgeon performed an intravitreal injection of 0.2 ml of 100% C3F8. How did you feel after the injection?\nPatient: Hmm, I didn't notice any immediate changes in my vision, but I did feel some relief after the injection.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. After 5 weeks, the OCT results (Fig. b) showed a separation of the vitreous from the macula in your right eye, which is a positive sign. However, it seems like your BCVA did not change. How do you feel about your vision now?\nPatient: Well, it still feels the same, doctor. I haven't noticed any significant improvement.\nDoctor: I understand. Although your BCVA didn't change, the foveal thickness in your right eye decreased to 270 \u03bcm, which is a positive development. This means that the injection was effective in reducing the thickness of the fovea, but it may take some time for your vision to improve.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, is there anything I need to do or follow up on, doctor?\nDoctor: At this point, I would recommend regular check-ups to monitor your eye condition and ensure that there are no further complications.

Have you been experiencing any discomfort or pain recently?\nPatient: Not really, but I've been feeling a bit off lately.\nDoctor: I understand. We've detected a large right renal mass with adrenal extension and tumor thrombus extending to the right atrium in your recent tests. Additionally, there are enhancing liver lesions, which are suggestive of metastatic disease (cT4N1M1). You also have a pulmonary embolus and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The biopsy of the mass revealed clear cell renal cell carcinoma, WHO ISUP nucleolar grade 3.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. We started you on Apixaban 10mg/day for the management of the pulmonary embolus. Initially, we prescribed Pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily, but later switched to Nivolumab after you developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to a duodenal ulcer.\nPatient: Hmm, I remember that.\nDoctor: Interval imaging 6 months after targeted therapy showed a decrease in the size of the primary renal mass, but the thrombus extension into the IVC still persisted. There was also new hilar lymphadenopathy and segmental pulmonary embolism. We continued Nivolumab and 3-month PET/CT showed further reduction in the size of the renal mass with thrombus extension now to the level of the liver.\nPatient: So there was some improvement?\nDoctor: Yes, there was. However, there were new enhancing masses in the liver suspicious for metastases with subcarinal, precarinal, and bilateral hilar mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We initiated Cabozantinib in addition to the Nivolumab in view of the new lymphadenopathy.\nPatient: How did I handle the new treatment?\nDoctor: You tolerated the new regimen very well and were completely symptom-free with this therapeutic combination. New imaging with PET/CT showed no FDG avid lesions anywhere in the body, including the IVC thrombus, with a significant reduction in the size of the renal mass. An MRI Angiogram of the abdomen showed the IVC thrombus invading the IVC lateral wall and situated below the hepatic veins.\nPatient: What's the next step then?\nDoctor: Based on the imaging, we've decided to proceed with posttherapy right cytoreductive nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy. We will stop the anticoagulant and perform bridging with Heparin prior to the surgery.\nPatient: What can I expect during the surgery?\nDoctor: Intraoperative findings may show a large renal mass with an infiltrating IVC thrombus in the retrohepatic location.

Let's start with a routine chest radiography.\n*After the test*\nDoctor: The radiography showed some enlargement of the upper mediastinum at the sternal angle, indicating a possible arch anomaly. We'll need to perform a barium swallow to get a clearer picture.\nPatient: Okay, what does that involve?\nDoctor: You'll swallow a liquid containing barium, which will help us see the esophagus more clearly on an X-ray.\n*After the barium swallow test*\nDoctor: The barium swallow revealed an indentation of the esophagus on its right aspect. We'll need to do a computed tomographic angiography (CTA) scan to further investigate this.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\n*After the CTA scan*\nDoctor: The CTA scan showed the presence of a right-sided aortic arch compressing your esophagus, causing your dysphagia. The left common carotid artery originates first, followed by the right common carotid artery, then the right subclavian artery and the left subclavian artery arising from a Kommerell diverticulum.\nPatient: So, what does this mean for me?\nDoctor: Since the patient presented with dysphagia due to esophageal compression, endovascular treatment is contraindicated. You'll need to undergo open repair to address this issue.\nPatient: I understand. What will that involve?\nDoctor: You'll be taken to the operating room where we'll use selective lung ventilation and cerebrospinal fluid drainage to prevent complications like paraplegia. We'll perform a right thoracotomy in the third intercostal space, identify and dissect the distal aortic arch and right subclavian artery, and carefully dissect the posterior wall of the Kommerell diverticulum until the left subclavian artery is of normal diameter.\nPatient: What will you do to prevent any injuries during the procedure?\nDoctor: We'll surround the vessel with a silicone tape and use a posterior approach to prevent injuries from the Kommerell dissection adjacent to the esophagus. A simple side-biting division of the aberrant subclavian at the junction with the aorta will be considered unsafe, so we'll use graft replacement with left heart bypass instead.\nPatient: What precautions will be taken during the procedure?\nDoctor: We'll administer Heparin 1 mg/kg and establish a left heart bypass from the right inferior pulmonary vein to the descending thoracic aorta under mild hypothermia (32-34\u00b0C) to ensure a safe procedure. Aortic clamping will be done between the right carotid artery and the right subclavian artery for a secure anastomosis.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor.

Based on these findings, we need to schedule a surgery for you to correct these issues.\nPatient: Oh, okay. When will the surgery be?\nDoctor: The surgery will be on November 24th, 2016. It will involve a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass to allow us to access the right atrial aneurysm and resect it. The tricuspid valve appears normal, but the annulus is dilated, so we'll also perform a ring annuloplasty to correct that.\nPatient: I understand, doc. I'm a bit nervous, but I trust you.\nDoctor: Thank you for your trust. We'll take great care of you. The surgery should go smoothly, and with proper postoperative care, your recovery should be uneventful.\n(After the surgery)\nDoctor: The surgery went well, and your postoperative course has been uneventful. We've conducted a follow-up chest X-ray and echocardiogram, and both are showing normal results. You should continue to monitor your condition and report any new symptoms or concerns.\nPatient: Thank you so much, doctor. I really appreciate everything you've done for me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Have you had any other health issues or eye problems in the past?\nPatient: No, not really. I did have a mild flu-like illness a week ago, but that's about it.\nDoctor: Alright, let's check your visual acuity. Your best corrected visual acuity is 0.5 in the right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. I'm going to perform some more tests to better understand your situation.\nPatient: Okay, sure.\nDoctor: Your anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure are within normal range in both eyes. However, the fundoscopic examination of your right eye shows splinter hemorrhages, optic nerve head hemorrhage, and cotton wool spots in the superior arcuate region. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with papillophlebitis.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Papillophlebitis is an inflammation of the vein in the optic nerve head. We'll need to run some more tests to determine the cause. I'm going to perform a fundus fluorescein angiography to check for any ischemic areas.\nPatient: Alright, go ahead.\nDoctor: The angiography results show no ischemic areas, but there is hypofluorescence in the areas corresponding to the hemorrhages and hyperfluorescence in the optic nerve head. Additionally, optical coherence tomography reveals macular edema and intraretinal edema, as well as hyperreflective spots in the nasal fovea corresponding to the areas affected by the occlusion. We'll need to conduct some laboratory and radiological tests to determine the etiology of the papillophlebitis.\nPatient: Okay, let me know what you find.\nDoctor: After a week, you mentioned experiencing numbness, pain, and tingling sensations in both lower legs. Have you noticed any motor weakness?\nPatient: Yes, it's been getting worse in both of my legs.\nDoctor: Due to the severity of your symptoms, you were admitted to the neurology clinic for advanced examination and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord, as well as complete blood count, electrolytes, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation tests, including serum levels of homocysteine, protein C and S, partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time, were all normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and anticardiolipin G and M were also within normal range. A lumbar puncture revealed no pathology.\nPatient: So, what's going on then?\nDoctor: You have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and will be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. This should help with your symptoms.\nPatient: I hope so. Will my vision get better too?\nDoctor: Yes, over the next three months, your symptoms improved, and your best corrected visual acuity in the right eye returned to 1.0 without any treatment for the ocular findings.\nPatient: That's a relief.

We'll need to do a computed tomography scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to get a better understanding of what's going on. \n(After the CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed multiple lung nodules up to 28 mm and thoracic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which suggest an advanced germ cell tumor. We'll need to check your serum tumor markers to confirm.\n(After the tumor marker tests)\nDoctor: Your alpha fetoprotein level is 71.8 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of up to 8.0 ng/mL. Your human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level is 2,003 mUI/mL, much higher than the normal range of up to 5.0 mUI/mL.

After that, we'll analyze the tissue to determine the type of tumor.\n(After the orchiectomy)\nDoctor: The pathologic report from the orchiectomy indicates that you have a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) in the form of embryonal carcinoma. The immunohistochemistry results show carcinoembryonic antigen, hCG, cancer antigen 125, C-KIT, and calretinin are negative, while placental alkaline phosphatase, AE1 to AE3, and CD30 are positive.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, you have intermediate-risk NSGCT according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group classification.

Your biopsy results show that you have stage IIA cutaneous melanoma. The melanocytic lesion on your left posterior arm was found to be an ulcerated primary melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1.75 mm and a mitotic index of 1/mm2. You underwent wide excision of the primary lesion, followed by a completion lymph node dissection (LND) of the left axillary basin. Your sentinel lymph node biopsy was initially deemed positive, but the histology from the LND showed capsular nevi within several regional lymph nodes, indicating a pathologic stage IIA, T2b melanoma. \nPatient: Hmm, okay. So, what happened next?\nDoctor: You remained disease-free for three years until an in-transit metastasis was detected near the primary site. After the excision of the lymphatic metastasis, you were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy of 50 Gy in 20 fractions to the left posterior arm, followed by one month of adjuvant systemic therapy with high-dose interferon (IFN).\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. But then I had another recurrence, right?\nDoctor: That's correct. One year later, you experienced a second local in-transit recurrence. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging and tissue confirmation revealed two to three metastatic melanoma lesions in your liver. Your hepatic metastasis was tested for the BRAF V600 mutation, but the result was negative.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What was the plan for treatment after that?\nDoctor: The planned treatment was to induce an anti-tumor immune response that could mediate systemic tumor regression, known as the abscopal effect. You received four doses of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) at 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks, with radiation to begin after two doses.\nPatient: Okay, and did the treatment work?\nDoctor: After two cycles of ipilimumab alone, a PET-CT scan showed progression of liver metastases, with enlargement of the two previous liver lesions and the development of five new hypermetabolic foci in the liver. The largest measured 2.3 x 2.5 cm. Subsequently, you were treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to two of the liver metastases with a total dose of 54 Gy in three fractions.\nPatient: That sounds intense. How am I doing now?\nDoctor: It's important to continue monitoring your condition closely and follow up with your oncologist for any changes or concerns. They will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information on your treatment and prognosis.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining my situation to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

I had a Computed Tomography (CT) scan for a medical checkup a year ago, and they found a small nodule in my left upper lobe (S1+2).\nDoctor: I see. Have you had any follow-up tests since then?\nPatient: Yes, I had a follow-up CT scan, and it showed that the nodule with indentation had grown to 22 mm in size.\nDoctor: Did you consult with any specialists or visit another hospital after that?\nPatient: I was referred to a nearby hospital, and they did some tests like Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), brain magnetic resonance imaging, and a transbronchial biopsy.\nDoctor: What were the results of those tests?\nPatient: They said I have left upper lung adenocarcinoma, classified as cT1bN0M0 Stage IA according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification (seventh edition).\nDoctor: I understand. Did they perform any contrast-enhanced three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3DCT) to check your pulmonary vessels before your treatment?\nPatient: No, they didn't do that test because of my renal dysfunction.\nDoctor: Alright. Were there any abnormalities found during your treatment?\nPatient: They said there was an abnormal branching of my left pulmonary artery, but they only identified it during the surgery.\nDoctor: What kind of surgery did you have?\nPatient: I had a Video-assisted thoracoscopic left upper lobectomy and lymphadenectomy.\nDoctor: How did the surgery go? Did they manage to separate the interlobar fissure?\nPatient: Yes, they carefully detached the upper pulmonary vein, mediastinal A4+5, A3, and A1+2a+b, and identified a pulmonary mediastinal branch from the left main pulmonary artery descending between the upper pulmonary vein and upper bronchus. They were able to separate the interlobar fissure safely, with preservation of A8.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Did they perform any retrospective examination after the surgery?\nPatient: Yes, they looked at my non-contrast CT scan, and it showed A8.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing your experience. It's important to monitor your recovery and schedule regular follow-up appointments. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about your treatment or follow-up care.",
